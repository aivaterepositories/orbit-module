## Progress Log

**2026-02-12:** Introduction call held with Dos and Kel (Kel had technical issues, partial attendance). Pitch deck presented. Follow-up email sent with deck link and meeting summary. Proposed follow-up call: Feb 12, 2:30 PM California time. See `la-elite-rentals-feb11-meeting-notes.md` for full notes.

**2026-02-07:** Project resumed. Fiona provided full documentation (SOPs, scripts, templates, processes). Nova compiled 30 automation opportunities and created pitch deck outline. Ready to schedule pitch with Kel.

**2026-02-04:** Project created, paused to prioritize Buster's Industrial demo (Feb 11-12).

## Notes

- Scale Virtually is a separate company Fiona works for as a process engineer
- This project originated from Scale Virtually engagement
- Aivate opportunity: Offer GHL automation services
- Kel's team is small (<5 people) — automation would significantly reduce manual work
