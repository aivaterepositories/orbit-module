## SLIDE 1: Title

**LA Elite Rentals**
*Automating Your Rental Operations in GoHighLevel*

Presented by Aivate

---

## SLIDE 2: The Opportunity

**Your business is growing. Your processes shouldn't hold you back.**

- You have a solid rental operation with clear processes
- Your VAs follow documented SOPs and scripts
- But they're spending hours on repetitive tasks that GHL can do automatically

**The gap:** GoHighLevel is installed but underutilized — automations and workflows aren't running.

---

## SLIDE 3: What We Found

**27+ manual touchpoints that can be automated**

| Category | Manual Tasks Today |
|----------|-------------------|
| Lead Response | VA calls/texts every new lead manually |
| Follow-Ups | VA remembers to follow up in 3 days |
| Payment Reminders | VA sends reminder text on due date |
| Intake Chasing | VA follows up when docs not submitted |
| Pickup Coordination | VA sends confirmation, reminders manually |
| Onboarding | VA copy/pastes welcome text + payment schedule |
| Maintenance Alerts | VA monitors Bouncie, texts renters |

**Result:** VAs are busy with admin instead of closing deals.

---

## SLIDE 4: The Cost of Manual

**Every manual task has a cost:**

- **Speed-to-lead:** 10-minute response window — manual = missed opportunities
- **Forgotten follow-ups:** Leads go cold, waitlist leads never contacted
- **Inconsistent messaging:** Different VAs send different versions
- **Payment delays:** Late reminders = late payments = cash flow issues
- **VA burnout:** Repetitive tasks reduce focus on high-value work

---

## SLIDE 5: The Solution — GHL Automation

**Let the system handle the repetitive work.**

GoHighLevel workflows can:
- Respond to new leads instantly (24/7)
- Send payment reminders automatically on the right day/time
- Follow up with leads who don't respond
- Move contacts through your pipeline based on their actions
- Notify your team only when human attention is needed

**Your VAs focus on:** Qualifying leads, coordinating pickups, handling exceptions.

## SLIDE 6: Phase 1 — Quick Wins (Week 1-2)

**Immediate impact, fast to build.**

| Automation | What It Does | Impact |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **Speed-to-Lead** | Instant text when new lead comes in | No more scrambling to respond in 10 mins |
| **Missed Call Text-Back** | Auto-text when call is missed | Capture leads even when lines are busy |
| **Payment Due Reminders** | 24hr + day-of + overdue sequence | Fewer late payments |
| **Post-Pickup Welcome** | Auto-send welcome kit + payment schedule | Consistent onboarding, no copy/paste |

**Estimated Build:** 4 workflows

---

## SLIDE 7: Phase 2 — Lead Nurturing (Week 2-3)

**Stop losing leads who aren't ready yet.**

| Automation | What It Does | Impact |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **3-Day Urgency Sequence** | "Last day to hold vehicle" follow-up | Creates urgency, increases conversions |
| **Intake Form Reminder** | Auto-remind if docs not submitted in 24hrs | Faster qualification |
| **Nurturing Drip** | Weekly touchpoint for "not ready" leads | Keeps pipeline warm |
| **Waitlist Reactivation** | Auto-notify when vehicle type available | Fills cars faster |

**Estimated Build:** 4 workflows

---

## SLIDE 8: Phase 3 — Retention & Growth (Week 3-4)

**Keep renters longer. Get referrals.**

| Automation | What It Does | Impact |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **Late Payment Escalation** | Auto-sequence: reminder → warning → final notice | Reduces chasing |
| **Weekly Check-In** | "How's everything going?" text | Catches issues early |
| **Referral Request** | After 30 days: "Know other drivers?" | Free lead generation |
| **Renewal Reminder** | 3 days before period ends | Reduces churn |

**Estimated Build:** 4 workflows

---

## SLIDE 9: Phase 4 — Internal Efficiency (Ongoing)

**Make your team faster.**

| Automation | What It Does | Impact |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **Auto-Task Creation** | Stage change → task assigned to VA | Nothing falls through cracks |
| **Stale Lead Alerts** | No activity 48hrs → auto-task | Keeps pipeline moving |
| **Denial Auto-Response** | Reason selected → appropriate message sent | Consistent, professional |
| **Stage Automation** | Actions trigger stage changes | Less manual updating |

**Estimated Build:** 4 workflows

---

## SLIDE 10: Integration Opportunities

**Connect your systems.**

| System | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bouncie** | Alerts trigger GHL tasks + renter texts |
| **RingCentral** | Missed calls trigger workflows |
| **Facebook Ads** | Leads import directly into nurturing sequence |
| **HQ Rentals** | Manual sync, but tags can trigger actions |

---

## SLIDE 11: What Your VAs Will Do Instead

**Before:** Copy/paste templates, remember to follow up, chase payments, monitor for alerts.

**After:**
- Qualify leads on calls (high-value conversations)
- Coordinate pickups with onsite team
- Handle exceptions and escalations
- Build relationships with renters

**Same team. Higher output. Less stress.**
