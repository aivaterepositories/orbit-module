# Aurora Sidecar Memory

**Agent:** Aurora (Frontend Designer & UI/UX Specialist)
**Module:** ORBIT
**Purpose:** Long-term memory for Aurora's design decisions and UI library choices

---

## What is Sidecar Memory?

Sidecar memory allows Aurora to maintain context across sessions by logging design decisions, patterns, and technical choices. This enables Aurora to:

1. **Recall past design systems** - Reference previous projects for consistency
2. **Track library usage** - Know which components and tools were used
3. **Learn from feedback** - Remember client preferences and adjustments
4. **Maintain standards** - Ensure consistent quality across all projects

## Files in This Directory

### 1. `design-decisions.md`
**Purpose:** Log of all design systems generated by Aurora

**When to Use:**
- After generating a design system with UI UX Pro Max
- When making significant design decisions
- After receiving client feedback on designs

**What to Log:**
- Project name, type, industry, style
- Color palette and typography choices
- Design pattern selected
- File paths to generated design systems
- Special considerations or customizations

---

### 2. `ui-libraries.md`
**Purpose:** Track UI libraries, components, and technical tools used

**When to Use:**
- When selecting component libraries for a project
- After choosing icon sets or animation libraries
- When documenting technical implementation details

**What to Log:**
- Libraries used (with versions if relevant)
- Component sources (custom vs library)
- Icon library choices
- Installation commands
- Technical notes and considerations

## How Aurora Uses Sidecar Memory

### At Workflow Start
1. **Read `design-decisions.md`** completely
2. Check for similar past projects
3. Learn from previous design choices
4. Apply consistent patterns when appropriate

### During Design System Generation
1. Generate design system using UI UX Pro Max
2. Save MASTER.md to design-system/{project}/
3. **Immediately log to `design-decisions.md`**
4. Log any libraries used to `ui-libraries.md`

### After Client Feedback
1. Update the relevant entry in `design-decisions.md`
2. Note feedback and adjustments made
3. Use feedback to improve future designs

## CRITICAL RULES for Aurora

1. ✅ **ALWAYS read design-decisions.md before starting design work**
2. ✅ **ALWAYS log after generating a design system**
3. ✅ **ONLY read/write files in this directory for sidecar memory**
4. ✅ **Include timestamps in all log entries**
5. ✅ **Reference past projects when relevant**
6. ❌ **NEVER delete or overwrite existing log entries**
7. ❌ **NEVER skip logging step after design system generation**

## Example Workflow with Sidecar Memory

```
User: "Generate design system for a fintech SaaS dashboard"

Aurora:
1. ✅ Reads design-decisions.md
2. ✅ Checks if similar fintech projects exist
3. ✅ Generates design system using UI UX Pro Max
4. ✅ Creates design-system/fintech-dashboard/MASTER.md
5. ✅ Logs to design-decisions.md with timestamp
6. ✅ Logs libraries used to ui-libraries.md
7. ✅ Presents design system to user
```
