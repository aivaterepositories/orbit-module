# LA Elite Rentals — Feb 11, 2026 Introduction Call

**Date:** February 11, 2026
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Attendees:**
- Fiona Cafe (Aivate - PM/Process Engineer)
- Marky Jalandoni (Aivate - Automation Specialist)
- Dos Espina (LA Elite Rentals - Admin/Lead Manager)
- Kel King (LA Elite Rentals - Owner) — *partial attendance due to technical issues*

---

## Meeting Context

This was an introduction call to present Aivate's GoHighLevel automation proposal to LA Elite Rentals. Kel King (Owner) experienced technical difficulties (audio not connecting, possibly CarPlay-related) and was unable to participate in most of the call. Dos Espina stepped in and engaged with the full presentation on Kel's behalf.

## What Was Presented

### The Problem
LA Elite has solid rental operations with documented SOPs and scripts, but VAs are spending hours on repetitive manual tasks that GoHighLevel can automate:

- Manual lead response (risking the 10-minute speed-to-lead window)
- Manual follow-ups (VA has to remember to follow up in 3 days)
- Manual payment reminders on due dates
- Manual intake form chasing
- Copy/pasting welcome texts and payment schedules
- Monitoring Bouncie for vehicle alerts

### The Solution
27+ automation opportunities identified across 4 phases:

| Phase | Focus | Duration |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Quick Wins — Speed-to-lead, missed call text-back, payment reminders, welcome kit | Week 1-2 |
| **Phase 2** | Lead Nurturing — Follow-up drips, intake form reminders, waitlist reactivation | Week 2-3 |
| **Phase 3** | Retention — Late payment escalation, check-ins, referral requests, renewals | Week 3-4 |
| **Phase 4** | Internal Efficiency — Auto-task creation, stale lead alerts, stage automation | Ongoing |

### Pricing Options Presented

| Option | Cost | Structure |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **Per Phase** | $750 × 4 = $3,000 | Pay as you go, evaluate each phase |
| **Retainer** | $1,250 + $350/mo | All phases + ongoing optimization for a year |
| **All-In** | $2,500 | Everything built in one month, one payment |

### Integration Opportunities Discussed
- Bouncie (vehicle monitoring)
- RingCentral (missed calls)
- Facebook Ads (lead import)
- HQ Rentals (booking management)
- Intelius (background checks — no API, requires workaround)

---

## Dos's Reception

Dos engaged positively throughout the presentation. Key moments:

- Confirmed current manual processes (CS sends reminders, twice-monthly check-ins)
- Acknowledged the value of automated task assignment
- Asked clarifying questions about how automations would work
- Agreed that manual work is consuming time that could be spent closing deals

Quote when asked about follow-up reception: "So far, so far" (positive)

## Technical Issues — Kel

Kel attempted to join multiple times but experienced persistent audio issues:
- Could not be heard on the call
- Likely connected via CarPlay which caused audio routing problems
- Eventually dropped off, leaving Dos to continue the call

This means Kel has not heard the full proposal and needs the pitch deck + summary to make a decision.

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Send pitch deck to Dos and Kel | Nova | ✅ Sent 2026-02-12 |
| Schedule follow-up call with Kel | Nova/Fiona | Proposed: Feb 12, 2:30 PM California |
| Kel to review deck and confirm meeting | Kel | Pending |
| Dos to brief Kel on call takeaways | Dos | Pending |

## Nova's Assessment

### Why This Project Matters

LA Elite Rentals represents exactly the kind of client Aivate should be working with:

1. **Clear processes already exist** — Fiona's process engineering work (SOPs, scripts, templates) has already documented how the business operates. We're not inventing workflows; we're automating existing ones.

2. **Underutilized platform** — They're paying for GoHighLevel but using it as a glorified contact list. The automation capabilities are sitting idle while VAs do manual work the system could handle.

3. **Scalability bottleneck** — Kel has a fleet operation with real growth potential. But every new car added means more manual follow-ups, more payment reminders, more intake chasing. Automation breaks that linear scaling problem.

4. **Revenue impact is tangible** — In car rentals, speed-to-lead directly affects conversion. A lead that waits 2 hours for a response has already called three competitors. Automated instant response captures those opportunities.

5. **The math works** — If automation saves even 2-3 deals that would have otherwise gone cold, the $2,500 investment pays for itself. And unlike a VA, workflows run 24/7 without breaks or sick days.

### Recommendation

Push for the **$2,500 all-in option**. It's:
- Cheaper than one month of a full-time VA
- Delivers permanent infrastructure (not ongoing labor cost)
- Shows commitment from both sides to get it done in a month
- Positions Aivate for ongoing optimization work after the build

### Risk

Kel didn't hear the presentation. The decision depends on:
1. Dos effectively communicating the value
2. Kel actually reviewing the pitch deck
3. A follow-up call where Kel can ask questions directly

Without Kel's buy-in, this stalls. The follow-up call tomorrow is critical.

## Next Steps

1. **Feb 12, 2:30 PM PT** — Follow-up call with Kel (pending confirmation)
2. If green light → Onboard to active pipeline, begin Phase 1
3. If questions → Address concerns, potentially adjust scope/pricing
4. If no response → Follow up in 48 hours
