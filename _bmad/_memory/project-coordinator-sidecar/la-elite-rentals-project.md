# LA Elite Rentals - GoHighLevel Optimization

**Status:** PAUSED (Prioritizing Buster's Industrial)
**Priority:** Medium
**Company:** LA Elite Rentals
**Client Contact:** Kel (Owner)
**Project Lead:** Fiona (PM / Process Engineer)
**Lead Developer:** Marky (GoHighLevel)
**Support:** Jacob (GoHighLevel)

## Project Overview

### Client Profile
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Company** | LA Elite Rentals |
| **Contact** | Kel (Owner) |
| **Business** | Car Rental |
| **Location** | Los Angeles, CA |
| **Internal Team** | <5 people (daily ops + lead gen/management) |
| **Current Systems** | GoHighLevel (CRM), HQ Rental (booking management) |
| **Payment Methods** | Zelle, Cash, Apple Pay, others |

### Problem Statement
- **GoHighLevel underutilized** — automations and workflows not being used
- **Manual processes** — drip campaigns, follow-up cadences done manually
- **Lead nurturing** — requires manual intervention instead of automation
- **Opportunity** — automate inside GHL instead of manual follow-ups

---

## Source & Context

### How This Client Came In
- Fiona was process engineering this client through **Scale Virtually** (another company Fiona works for)
- During process engineering calls, discovered GHL automation gaps
- Created a lead management playbook for the client
- Opportunity to pitch Aivate services for GHL optimization

### Existing Work (Scale Virtually)
Fiona has already created for this client:
- [ ] SOPs (to be documented)
- [ ] Scripts (to be documented)
- [ ] Templates (to be documented)
- [ ] Lead management playbook

**Note:** Fiona to paste these materials when project resumes.

## Technical Context

### Current Systems

| System | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **GoHighLevel** | Main CRM | Lead gen, lead management, automations |
| **HQ Rental** | Booking management | Rental organization |
| **Payment** | Zelle, Cash, Apple Pay | Multiple payment methods |

### Current State (GHL)
- Several automations in place but need upgrading
- Drip campaigns — currently manual
- Follow-up cadences — currently manual
- Workflows — not being utilized
- Lead nurturing — manual process

### Opportunity Areas
1. **Automate drip campaigns** inside GHL
2. **Automate follow-up cadences** — no manual follow-ups needed
3. **Lead nurturing workflows** — automated sequences
4. **Upgrade existing automations** — improve what's already there

## Proposed Team

| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Project Manager** | Fiona | Client comms, process engineering, coordination |
| **Lead GHL Engineer** | Marky | GHL automations, workflows, setup |
| **GHL Support** | Jacob | GHL implementation support |

### Marky's Relevant Experience
- First-hand experience fixing GoHighLevel automations
- Has set up GHL for other clients
- Will be lead engineer/developer for systems

---

## Objective

Identify automation opportunities within GoHighLevel to pitch to Kel for buy-in on Aivate services.

### Deliverables (When Resumed)
1. **Automation audit** — Map current manual processes
2. **Opportunity report** — Identify automation candidates
3. **Quick wins vs. larger builds** — Prioritize by effort/impact
4. **Pitch deck** — Present to Kel for buy-in
5. **Implementation scope** — For Marky and Jacob

---

## Next Steps (When Resumed)

1. Fiona to paste SOPs, scripts, and templates created for Kel
2. Map current manual processes → automation candidates
3. Identify quick wins vs. larger workflow builds
4. Structure the pitch for Kel's buy-in
5. Scope the engagement for Marky and Jacob

---

## Why Paused

- **Buster's Industrial** has a firm demo deadline (Feb 11-12)
- LA Elite Rentals is not time-sensitive at the moment
- Will resume after Buster's demo is complete
- **Fiona to provide more context/updates tomorrow (Feb 5)**

---

## Notes

- Scale Virtually is a separate company Fiona works for as a process engineer
- This project originated from Scale Virtually engagement
- Aivate opportunity: Offer GHL automation services
- Kel's team is small (<5 people) — automation would significantly reduce manual work
