## 1. Executive Summary

The Scale Virtually Referral Program is a strategic growth initiative designed to leverage our most valuable assets—our people and our satisfied clients—to drive sustainable business expansion. This program creates a structured, incentivized framework that empowers Support Team members and existing clients to refer new business owners who could benefit from Scale Virtually's virtual assistant services.

By formalizing the referral process, we aim to:
- Accelerate growth toward our 300+ active client-VA pair target
- Reward team members and clients who contribute to company growth
- Ensure consistent tracking and fair attribution of referrals
- Maintain quality standards for incoming clients
- Create an additional revenue stream beyond traditional sales channels

This document serves as the definitive guide for all aspects of the Referral Program, including eligibility, incentives, processes, tracking, and policies. All team members involved in the referral process should familiarize themselves with this SOP to ensure consistent execution and fair treatment of all participants.

## 2. Purpose & Business Rationale

### 2.1 Why This Program Exists

Scale Virtually has built a strong reputation for providing high-quality virtual assistant services to business owners. Our current client base of 229 active client-VA pairs represents years of relationship building, service delivery, and trust cultivation. However, to achieve our growth objectives and expand our impact, we need to tap into new channels for client acquisition.

Traditional sales and marketing efforts—while effective—have limitations:
- They require significant investment in advertising and outreach
- Cold leads often have lower conversion rates
- Building trust with new prospects takes time
- The sales cycle can be lengthy

**Referrals, by contrast, offer significant advantages:**

1. **Higher Trust Factor:** When a satisfied client or trusted team member recommends Scale Virtually, the new prospect already has a level of trust established. They're not hearing about us from an advertisement—they're hearing about us from someone they know and trust.

2. **Better Quality Leads:** Referrals tend to be better qualified because the referrer understands both Scale Virtually's services and the referred person's needs. They're making a connection because they genuinely believe it's a good fit.

3. **Faster Sales Cycle:** Referred prospects typically move through the sales funnel more quickly because much of the "education" phase has already been handled by the referrer.

4. **Lower Acquisition Cost:** While we do pay referral incentives, the overall cost of acquiring a client through referral is often lower than through paid advertising or extensive sales efforts.

5. **Stronger Retention:** Studies consistently show that referred clients tend to have higher retention rates. They came in with realistic expectations set by the referrer and are more likely to stay long-term.

### 2.2 The Opportunity We're Capturing

Our Support Team members interact with clients daily. They understand their needs, hear about their business challenges, and often learn about their networks. When a client mentions that a friend or colleague is struggling with tasks that a VA could handle, that's a referral opportunity.

Similarly, our existing clients are often connected to other business owners. Entrepreneurs tend to network with other entrepreneurs. When our clients are happy with their VA, they naturally talk about it. This program gives them a reason to formalize that word-of-mouth into an actual referral.

**Without a structured program:**
- These opportunities slip through the cracks
- Team members don't know how to handle potential referrals
- There's no tracking to ensure fair credit
- There's no incentive to actively pursue referrals
- We miss out on growth potential

**With this program:**
- Every team member knows exactly how to submit a referral
- Clear incentives motivate proactive referral behavior
- Transparent tracking ensures fair attribution
- The company captures growth that would otherwise be lost
- Everyone wins—the referrer, the company, and the new client

### 2.3 Strategic Alignment

This Referral Program aligns with Scale Virtually's broader strategic objectives:

| Strategic Goal | How the Referral Program Supports It |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Grow to 300+ active pairs | Direct path to adding 70+ new pairs through referrals |
| Increase revenue | New clients = new recurring revenue |
| Reduce acquisition costs | Referrals cost less than traditional marketing |
| Improve client quality | Referred clients are pre-vetted and better fits |
| Increase retention | Referred clients historically have higher retention |
| Engage and reward team | Incentives create additional earning opportunities |
| Strengthen client relationships | Clients feel valued when rewarded for referrals |

## 3. Program Objectives & Goals

### 3.1 Primary Objective

**Grow Scale Virtually's active client-VA pairs from 229 to 300+ by the end of 2025** through high-quality referrals from internal team members and existing clients.

## 6. Eligibility Requirements

### 6.1 Who Can Submit Referrals

#### 6.1.1 Support Team Members

The following team members are eligible to submit referrals and earn Support Team incentives:

- Client Success Managers (CSMs)
- Support Managers
- Department Heads (e.g., Aja, Boom)
- Other operations staff who interact with clients

**Eligibility Criteria:**
- Must be a current, active employee of Scale Virtually
- Employment status (full-time, part-time, contractor) does not affect eligibility
- Performance status (including NT status) does not affect eligibility — see Section 12.2 for details

#### 6.1.2 Existing Clients

Existing clients are eligible to submit referrals and earn Client referral rewards if they meet the following criteria:

- Must be an **active client** — currently paying for VA services
- Must be in **good standing** — account is current, no outstanding payment issues
- Must not be in the process of canceling or churning

**Note:** Clients who have recently churned are not eligible. The referral must be submitted while they are still an active, paying client.

### 6.2 Who Can Be Referred

A prospect can be submitted as a referral if they meet **all** of the following criteria:

1. **New to Scale Virtually**
   - The prospect is not already in the CRM system
   - The prospect is not currently in the sales pipeline
   - The prospect has not previously been a Scale Virtually client

2. **Legitimate Business Owner**
   - The prospect is a real business owner or decision-maker who has authority to hire a VA
   - The prospect has a genuine need for virtual assistant services

3. **No Self-Referrals**
   - Referrers cannot refer themselves
   - Referrers cannot refer their own company under a different name
   - Referrers cannot refer family members posing as separate businesses when they are not

4. **No Duplicate Referrals**
   - If the same prospect has already been submitted by someone else, the first submission owns the referral
   - The sales team will validate all submissions against existing records

### 6.3 Special Eligibility Situations

#### Team Members on Notice to Explain (NT)

Team members who are currently on NT status (have received a formal warning regarding performance) **are still eligible** to participate in the Referral Program.

**Rationale:** The Referral Program is separate from individual performance management. A team member's ability to identify and submit referrals is independent of any performance concerns being addressed through HR processes. Excluding them would be punitive beyond the scope of the NT process.

#### Team Members Transitioning Out

Team members who have submitted resignation or who are in the process of being separated from the company:
- May still submit referrals up until their last day
- Are subject to the resignation payout rules (see Section 12.4)

#### Clients with Payment Issues

Clients who are behind on payments or have unresolved billing issues are **not eligible** to submit referrals until their account is brought current.

## 7. Referral Success Criteria

### 7.1 What Makes a Referral "Successful"

A referral is only considered successful—and eligible for incentive payouts—when **all** of the following conditions are met:

| Criterion | Description | Verification |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **1. New Client** | The referral was not already in the CRM or pipeline | Sales validates against CRM |
| **2. Signs Contract** | The referral signs a service agreement with Scale Virtually | Sales/Amanda confirms |
| **3. Pays Startup Fee (SUF)** | The referral pays the required Startup Fee | Finance confirms |
| **4. Pays First Invoice** | The referral pays their first regular monthly invoice | Finance confirms |
| **5. Remains Active** | The referral continues as an active client through milestone periods | Ops tracks monthly |

**Important:** A referral that signs but never pays the SUF or first invoice is **not** a successful referral and does not trigger any incentives.

### 7.2 The First-Touch Rule

When multiple people attempt to submit the same referral, ownership is determined by the **First-Touch Rule**:

> **The referral is credited to whoever submits the referral via the intake form first.**

This rule exists to:
- Provide clear, objective criteria for ownership
- Prevent disputes about who "really" found the client
- Encourage prompt submission of referrals
- Create a paper trail through the intake form

**Key Points:**

1. **Timestamp Matters:** The intake form submission timestamp is the definitive record of who submitted first.

2. **Documentation Required:** The referrer should be able to show that they had contact with or knowledge of the prospect. This can include:
   - Email correspondence
   - Text/chat messages
   - Notes from a client conversation
   - Any documentation showing the connection

3. **No Retroactive Claims:** If Person A submits a referral and Person B later claims they "knew about" the prospect, the referral still belongs to Person A. Submit first, or don't receive credit.

4. **Sales Validates:** The sales team (Joel) reviews all submissions and validates ownership. If there's a clear case of someone submitting a referral they had no genuine connection to, that submission may be rejected.

### 7.3 Milestone Definitions

Referral incentives are paid out based on reaching specific milestones. Here's how each milestone is defined:

| Milestone | Definition | Triggered When |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Signs & First Invoice Paid** | The referral has signed the contract AND paid both the SUF and first invoice | Finance confirms first invoice payment |
| **3-Month Mark** | The referred client has been active for 3 full months (90 days) from sign date | Calendar date reached; client still active |
| **90-Day Mark (Upsells)** | A new VA seat has been active for 90 days | Calendar date reached; seat still active |
| **4 Total Referrals (Client Bonus)** | A client has accumulated 4 successful referrals total | 4th referral reaches "successful" status |

---

## 8. Incentive Structure

### 8.1 Support Team Referral Incentives

Support Team members who successfully refer new clients earn cash incentives based on the following structure:

| Milestone | Incentive Amount | Cumulative Total |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Client signs & first invoice paid | $100 | $100 |
| Client reaches 3-month mark | $100 | $200 |
| **Total Per Referral** | — | **$200** |

**Payout Details:**

- **First Payout ($100):** Released after Finance confirms that the referred client has signed the contract AND paid both the Startup Fee and first monthly invoice.

- **Second Payout ($100):** Released after the referred client has been active for 3 full months (90 days) from their sign date and remains an active, paying client.

**Why This Structure:**

The tiered payout structure is designed to:
1. Reward initial success (getting the client to sign and pay)
2. Encourage referrers to refer quality clients who will stay long-term
3. Protect the company from paying full incentives for clients who churn quickly
4. Align referrer interests with company interests (retention matters)

### 8.2 Client Referral Incentives (Service Credits)

Existing clients who refer new business owners earn service credits that can be applied to their future invoices:

| Milestone | Incentive | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Referral signs & pays SUF | $250 service credit | Applied to client's account |
| **Bonus:** 4 total successful referrals | 1 week free service | Cumulative bonus |

**Service Credit Details:**

- **$250 Credit:** Applied to the referring client's account after Finance confirms that the referred prospect has signed and paid the Startup Fee.

- **1 Week Free Bonus:** When a client accumulates 4 total successful referrals (lifetime, not per period), they receive 1 week of free VA service. This is a one-time bonus per client.

**How Service Credits Work:**

1. Credits are applied to the client's account balance
2. Credits automatically apply to the next invoice
3. If the credit exceeds the invoice amount, the remainder carries forward
4. Credits do not expire as long as the client remains active
5. Credits are non-transferable and cannot be cashed out

**Why Service Credits (Not Cash):**

Service credits are used for client referrals instead of cash because:
1. They keep the client engaged with Scale Virtually services
2. They're easier to administer (no tax implications for the client)
3. They encourage continued use of services
4. They represent meaningful value ($250+ is significant)

### 8.3 Upsell Incentives

When a team member facilitates adding a new VA seat to an existing client's account, they earn an upsell incentive:

| Milestone | Incentive Amount |
|-----------|------------------|
| New seat completes 90 days | $100 |

**Upsell Eligibility:**

- The upsell must be for a **new** VA seat (not replacing an existing one)
- The team member must have been involved in identifying or facilitating the upsell
- The new seat must remain active for 90 days to trigger the payout

**Upsell Process:**

Unlike external referrals, upsells do not go through the sales pipeline. If a Support Team member identifies that a client needs an additional VA:

1. The team member can facilitate the conversation directly with the client
2. No need to involve sales — this is handled by fulfillment
3. Document the upsell in the tracker
4. Finance confirms the new seat and starts the 90-day clock

### 8.4 Incentive Summary Table

| Referrer Type | Milestone | Incentive | Total Possible |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Support Team** | Sign + first invoice | $100 | |
| | 3-month mark | $100 | **$200/referral** |
| **Client** | Sign + SUF | $250 credit | |
| | 4 total referrals | 1 week free | **$250+/referral** |
| **Upsell** | 90-day mark | $100 | **$100/seat** |

### 8.5 No Cap on Referrals

**There is no limit to the number of referrals a person can submit.**

- A Support Team member can refer 1 client or 100 clients—each successful referral earns the full incentive
- A client can refer as many business owners as they know—each successful referral earns the full service credit
- There is no monthly, quarterly, or annual cap

**Why No Cap:**

Caps would discourage prolific referrers from continuing to refer after hitting a limit. Scale Virtually wants to maximize referrals, so we've intentionally removed any ceiling.

```

### 9.2 Detailed Process Steps

#### Step 1: Identify a Potential Referral

**Who:** Referrer (Support Team member or Client)

**What Happens:**
The referrer identifies someone who might benefit from Scale Virtually's services. This can happen through:

- A client mentioning a friend or colleague who needs help
- A team member's personal network (friends, family, former colleagues)
- A conversation where someone expresses challenges that a VA could solve
- A client directly asking how to refer someone

**Before Submitting:**
The referrer should do a quick mental check:
- Is this person a business owner or decision-maker?
- Do they have a genuine need for VA services?
- Are they likely not already a Scale Virtually client?
- Am I willing to have my name associated with this referral?

**Best Practice:** If you're a Support Team member and a client mentions a potential referral, gather basic information (name, company, contact info) before the conversation ends.

#### Step 2: Submit the Referral via Intake Form

**Who:** Referrer

**What Happens:**
The referrer completes the Referral Intake Form with all required information.

**Required Information:**
- Referral's full name
- Company name
- Contact information (email, phone)
- Referrer's name
- Referrer type (Support Team / Client)
- Date of submission
- Brief description of how you know this person / context for the referral
- Any relevant notes (their needs, best time to contact, etc.)

**Important Notes:**
- Submit as soon as possible after identifying the referral — first-touch rule applies
- Provide accurate contact information — incorrect info delays the process
- Include context — this helps Amanda tailor the discovery call
- Be honest — don't exaggerate your connection to the referral

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Insert Intake Form Screenshot]**
> *Form pending creation by Boom — will be JotForm or Google Form*

#### Step 3: Sales Validates and Tags Referral Owner

**Who:** Joel (Sales)

**What Happens:**
Joel reviews the intake form submission and performs validation:

1. **Check CRM:** Is this person already in the CRM as a client or prospect?
2. **Check Pipeline:** Is this person already being worked by sales?
3. **Check for Duplicates:** Has someone else already submitted this same referral?

**If Valid:**
- The referral is tagged with the referral owner's name
- The referral is added to the tracker with "Lead" status
- Joel schedules a discovery call

**If Invalid (Duplicate or Existing):**
- The referrer is notified that the referral cannot be accepted
- Reason is documented (already a client, already in pipeline, duplicate submission)
- No further action on this submission

**Timeline:** Validation should occur within 1-2 business days of submission.

#### Step 4: Discovery Call and Close

**Who:** Amanda (CEO), with calendar support from Joel

**What Happens:**
Amanda conducts a discovery call with the referred prospect to:
- Understand their business and needs
- Explain Scale Virtually's services
- Determine if there's a good fit
- Present pricing and packages
- Handle objections and questions
- Close the deal (if appropriate)

**Possible Outcomes:**

| Outcome | What Happens Next |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Closed - Won** | Prospect signs contract; proceeds to onboarding |
| **Closed - Lost** | Prospect declines; referral marked as "Lost" in tracker |
| **Nurturing** | Prospect interested but not ready; stays in pipeline |
| **Not a Fit** | Prospect's needs don't match SV services; marked "Lost" |

**Note on Future Closers:**
Currently, Amanda handles all discovery calls and closes. In the future, this may expand to include Department Heads like Boom and Aja who will also be trained to close referral deals.

#### Step 5: Onboarding the New Client

**Who:** Operations / Fulfillment Team

**What Happens:**
Once a referral signs, they go through the standard Scale Virtually onboarding process:
- Contract execution
- Startup Fee payment
- VA matching
- Kickoff and training
- First month of service

This step is handled by Operations and is outside the scope of this referral SOP, but it's important because the referral must complete onboarding and pay their first invoice before the referrer receives any incentive.

#### Step 6: Finance Confirms Payments

**Who:** Finance

**What Happens:**
Finance confirms key payment milestones that trigger referral incentives:

| Payment | What Finance Confirms |
|---------|----------------------|
| Startup Fee (SUF) | SUF has been paid in full |
| First Invoice | First monthly invoice has been paid |

Finance notifies Operations when these payments are confirmed so the tracker can be updated.

#### Step 7: Operations Updates Tracker

**Who:** Operations

**What Happens:**
Operations maintains the referral tracker and updates it:

- **Upon Validation:** New referral added with "Lead" status
- **Upon Close:** Status updated to "Closed" with sign date
- **Upon SUF Payment:** Finance confirmation noted
- **Upon First Invoice:** Status updated to "Active"; first payout triggered
- **Monthly:** Check for milestone dates (3-month, 90-day)
- **Upon Milestone:** Update tracker; notify Finance to release payout

**Frequency:** The tracker should be reviewed and updated at least weekly, with a comprehensive monthly review to catch all milestones.

#### Step 8: Finance Releases Incentives

**Who:** Finance

**What Happens:**
Finance processes incentive payouts based on tracker updates:

**For Support Team (Cash):**
- First payout ($100) released after first invoice confirmation
- Second payout ($100) released after 3-month milestone
- Paid through regular payroll cycle or direct deposit

**For Clients (Service Credits):**
- $250 credit applied to client account after SUF payment
- 1-week free bonus applied when 4th referral milestone is reached
- Credits appear on next invoice

**Documentation:**
Finance maintains records of all incentive payouts for audit purposes.

### 9.3 Process Timeline

Here's a typical timeline for a successful referral:

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Day 0 | Referrer submits intake form |
| Day 1-2 | Joel validates and schedules discovery call |
| Day 3-7 | Amanda conducts discovery call |
| Day 7-14 | Prospect decides; signs contract |
| Day 14-21 | Prospect pays SUF |
| Day 21-30 | VA matching and onboarding |
| Day 30-45 | First invoice generated and paid |
| **Day 45** | **First incentive released** |
| Day 135 | 3-month milestone reached |
| **Day 135** | **Second incentive released** |

*Note: Timeline varies based on prospect decision time, onboarding complexity, and billing cycles.*

### 9.4 Upsell Process (Variation)

The upsell process is simpler because it doesn't involve sales:

1. **Identify:** Support Team member identifies existing client needs additional VA
2. **Discuss:** Team member discusses with client directly
3. **Facilitate:** Team member facilitates the upsell (no sales involvement needed)
4. **Document:** Log the upsell in the tracker
5. **Track:** Ops tracks the 90-day milestone
6. **Payout:** Finance releases $100 after 90 days

## 10. Referral Tracking System

### 10.1 Purpose of the Tracker

The Referral Tracker serves as the **single source of truth** for all referral-related information. It:

- Records all referral submissions
- Tracks ownership (who referred whom)
- Monitors status through the sales process
- Tracks milestone dates
- Documents incentive payouts
- Provides visibility to leadership
- Enables reporting on program performance

### 10.2 Tracker Location and Access

**Location:** Google Sheet (linked to intake form)

**Access Levels:**

| Support Team | No direct access (submit via form only) |

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Check all "Active" referrals for upcoming milestones
- [ ] Identify any referrals reaching 3-month mark this month
- [ ] Identify any upsells reaching 90-day mark this month
- [ ] Verify all payment confirmations are up to date
- [ ] Ensure all payouts have been processed
- [ ] Update any status changes
- [ ] Archive any "Lost" or "Churned" referrals older than 6 months

- [ ] Is the information complete and accurate?

## 12. Rules, Policies & Edge Cases

### 12.1 Anti-Abuse Rules

To protect the integrity of the Referral Program, the following anti-abuse rules apply:

**Prohibited Activities:**

1. **Self-Referrals:** You cannot refer yourself, your own company, or a company you have ownership interest in.

2. **Fake Referrals:** Submitting fictitious people or companies is grounds for immediate disqualification and potential disciplinary action.

3. **Shared Companies:** Submitting a referral that is actually the same company as another referral (e.g., different DBAs of the same owner) is prohibited.

4. **Referral Farming:** Creating artificial referrals through shell companies, friends posing as business owners without real businesses, or similar schemes.

5. **Stealing Credit:** Submitting a referral you know someone else is actively working on, or that is already in the pipeline.

6. **Misrepresentation:** Falsely claiming a connection to a prospect or misrepresenting how you learned of them.

**Consequences:**
- First offense: Referral disqualified; warning issued
- Second offense: Suspension from referral program
- Third offense: Permanent ban from referral program; potential disciplinary action

### 12.2 Team Members on Notice to Explain (NT)

**Policy:** Team members who are currently on NT status **remain eligible** to participate in the Referral Program.

**Rationale:**
- The Referral Program is separate from performance management
- Referring clients is a different activity than core job responsibilities
- Excluding NT team members would be unduly punitive
- A team member can have performance issues while still having valuable networks

**Important:** While NT team members can participate, their NT status continues to be handled through normal HR processes. Good referral performance does not offset or replace addressing performance concerns.

### 12.3 No Cap on Referrals

**Policy:** There is no limit to the number of referrals a person can submit.

**Details:**
- No monthly cap
- No quarterly cap
- No annual cap
- No lifetime cap

A referrer who submits 50 successful referrals in a year earns the full incentive for each one.

### 12.4 Resignation or Departure

**Policy:** If a referrer leaves Scale Virtually (voluntarily or involuntarily), they are entitled to incentives only for milestones reached **before** their departure.

**How It Works:**

| Milestone Status at Departure | What Happens |
|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Referral signed, first invoice paid BEFORE departure | Referrer receives first payout ($100) |
| 3-month mark reached BEFORE departure | Referrer receives second payout ($100) |
| Referral signed but first invoice NOT paid before departure | Referrer receives nothing |
| 3-month mark NOT reached before departure | Referrer does not receive second payout |

**Example Scenario:**
- Maria (Support Team) refers Client X on January 1
- Client X signs and pays first invoice on February 1
- Maria resigns on February 15
- Client X reaches 3-month mark on May 1

**Payout Outcome:**
- Maria RECEIVES the $100 first payout (milestone met before resignation)
- Maria does NOT receive the $100 second payout (milestone not met before resignation)

**Rationale:** This policy:
- Rewards work that was completed during employment
- Protects the company from paying for milestones reached after departure
- Is fair and consistent across all departure scenarios

### 12.5 Referral Churn

**Policy:** If a referred client churns (cancels service) before reaching a milestone, future milestones are cancelled.

**How It Works:**

| Churn Timing | What Happens |
|--------------|--------------|
| Before first invoice paid | No incentive paid; referral marked "Churned" |
| After first invoice, before 3 months | First payout stands; second payout cancelled |
| After 3 months | Both payouts already released; no clawback |

**Important:** There is **no clawback** of incentives already paid. If a client churns after the referrer received a payout, that payout is not recovered.

### 12.6 Disputed Referrals

**Policy:** If there's a dispute about referral ownership, Amanda makes the final decision.

**Dispute Process:**
1. Either party raises the dispute with Operations
2. Operations gathers information from both parties
3. Operations reviews intake form timestamps and documentation
4. If clear (one submitted first with valid connection), Operations resolves
5. If unclear, Amanda reviews and makes final determination
6. Amanda's decision is final

**Common Dispute Scenarios:**

- **"I told them about it but they submitted first"** → First-touch rule applies; submitter wins
- **"They submitted my contact"** → If you have documentation of prior relationship, you may win
- **"We both submitted at the same time"** → Earlier timestamp wins; if exact same time, shared credit

### 12.7 Client Becomes Inactive

If a referring client becomes inactive (churns) after submitting referrals:

- Credits earned before churning remain on account (in case they return)
- Credits cannot be cashed out
- Pending referrals still in pipeline are still processed
- If pending referral closes, credit is applied (and will be there if client returns)

### 12.8 Re-Referring a Lost Referral

**Policy:** If a referral was previously submitted and marked "Lost," and later decides to sign up, the original referrer still owns the referral (within 12 months).

**Time Limit:** 12 months from original submission. After 12 months, the referral is considered "fresh" and can be submitted by anyone.

## 13. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: Who can participate in the Referral Program?**
A: Support Team members (CSMs, Support Managers, Department Heads) and active, paying clients can participate. VA incentives are pending finalization.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many referrals I can submit?**
A: No. There is no cap on the number of referrals you can submit. Each successful referral earns the full incentive.

**Q: How do I submit a referral?**
A: Complete the Referral Intake Form with the prospect's information. The form link will be provided by Operations.

**Q: How long does it take to get paid?**
A: The first payout is released after the referral pays their first invoice (typically 30-45 days after signing). The second payout comes at the 3-month mark.

### Eligibility Questions

**Q: I'm on a Notice to Explain (NT). Can I still refer?**
A: Yes. The Referral Program is separate from performance management. You remain eligible while on NT status.

**Q: Can I refer a family member or friend?**
A: Yes, as long as they are a legitimate business owner with a genuine need for VA services and meet all referral criteria.

**Q: Can I refer my own company under a different name?**
A: No. Self-referrals are prohibited.

**Q: I'm a client. Can my VA refer someone too?**
A: VA incentives are pending finalization. Check with Operations for current status.

### Process Questions

**Q: How do I know if my referral was accepted?**
A: Joel will validate your submission within 1-2 business days. You'll be notified if there's an issue.

**Q: What if someone else submits the same referral?**
A: The first-touch rule applies—whoever submitted first owns the referral.

**Q: What if my referral decides not to sign up?**
A: The referral is marked "Lost" in the tracker. No incentive is paid for referrals that don't convert.

**Q: Can I check on the status of my referral?**
A: Contact Operations for a status update. The tracker is not directly accessible to referrers.

### Incentive Questions

**Q: When do I get paid?**
A: Support Team members receive cash payouts through regular payroll. Clients receive service credits applied to their accounts.

**Q: What if my referral churns after I get the first payout?**
A: You keep the first payout. There's no clawback. However, you won't receive the second payout.

**Q: What if I resign before my referral reaches the 3-month mark?**
A: You'll receive payouts only for milestones reached before your departure date.

**Q: Can clients cash out their service credits?**
A: No. Service credits can only be applied to future invoices.

### Upsell Questions

**Q: How is an upsell different from a referral?**
A: A referral is a new client. An upsell is an additional VA seat for an existing client.

**Q: Do I need to involve sales for an upsell?**
A: No. Support Team members can facilitate upsells directly with existing clients.

**Q: What's the payout for upsells?**
A: $100 when the new seat completes 90 days.

**Outcome:** Maria owns the referral.

### Scenario 3: Referrer Resigns Mid-Process

**Situation:** Lisa refers a client on January 1. The client signs on February 1 and pays their first invoice on February 15. Lisa resigns on March 1. The client reaches 3 months on May 1.

**Payout Calculation:**
- First invoice paid (Feb 15) → Before resignation (Mar 1) → **$100 paid**
- 3-month mark (May 1) → After resignation (Mar 1) → **$100 NOT paid**

**Total paid to Lisa: $100**

### Scenario 4: Client Referral with Bonus

**Situation:** Acme Corp (an active client) loves their VA and starts referring other business owners:
- Referral 1 signs and pays SUF → $250 credit
- Referral 2 signs and pays SUF → $250 credit
- Referral 3 signs and pays SUF → $250 credit
- Referral 4 signs and pays SUF → $250 credit + **1 week free bonus**

**Total earned: $1,000 in service credits + 1 week free**

### Scenario 5: Referral Churns

**Situation:** Mike refers Sarah, who signs up and pays her first invoice. Mike receives his $100. Two months later, Sarah decides to cancel her service.

**What Happens:**
- Mike keeps his $100 (no clawback)
- Mike does NOT receive the second $100 (3-month milestone not reached)
- Sarah is marked "Churned" in the tracker

**Total paid to Mike: $100**

### Scenario 6: Upsell Success

**Situation:** Rachel is supporting client GlobalTech, which has one VA. During a check-in call, the client mentions they're growing fast and could use another VA for their sales team.

1. Rachel discusses options with the client
2. GlobalTech agrees to add a second VA seat
3. Rachel documents the upsell in the tracker
4. Operations matches a new VA for the sales tasks
5. 90 days later, the new VA is still active
6. **Rachel receives $100**

**Total earned: $100**

### Scenario 7: Failed Validation

**Situation:** Tom submits a referral for "ABC Company." Joel checks the CRM and finds that ABC Company is already an active client.

**What Happens:**
- Joel rejects the submission
- Tom is notified that ABC Company is already a client
- No entry is added to the tracker
- No incentive is possible

**Lesson:** Always check if you're sure someone isn't already a client before submitting.
