  Who would be the people, the first people or the first supports who will utilize our CRM and how are we going to attack that, right?  So let me just make sure that I do have my Fathom in. Okay, here we go. And so I'll also share my screen.  By the way, guys, I think it's the first time, Jacob and Marky, that you see Wayne. Wayne is from Chris Yates' team.  And Wayne, would you like to say something first to our developers?

0:33 - Wayne McCoy
  How are you doing? Hi, Wayne.

0:40 - Cob Bautista
  Finally, a face to the name.

0:42 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  They all know you, Wayne, because they've been like reading a lot of the SOPs in the demo or the CRM itself.  There's like a lot of mentioning of your names there, because you're one of the top users of the CRM in the future.  So they know you so Well, all right, without further ado, let me go ahead and share my screen here.  Okay, so Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, the way that you want to run this meeting is we'll go over the platform again, the CRM again, and then we'll ask Wayne how this feel about, you know, the different workarounds in the CRM so far, is that correct?  Right, yeah. Okay, all right, so am I sharing my entire screen? Are you guys seeing the CRM platform, Tempour Systems?  Okay, perfect. All right, so if you are an admin, let's say an internal team, this is your welcoming page, right?  Where you will be entering your email address or your username here, which will be given to you by us, right?  At the moment, how we built it is that We will be the one to create the credentials. Your user ID or your email address and your password.  And all you have to do is just to reset your password when you are logged in. So let's say I am an admin.  part of Chris Yates team or Temp Power Systems team. And then I am going to enter my password. I'll just have to log in.  Then you'll see here as well, Wayne, there is a log in as a crew member because there is a separate interface for a crew portal.  Later on, I'll walk you through that. But let's deep dive first on what we can see if you are an admin.  Right. So I'm going to log in. And then the very first thing that you'll see here is the dashboard.  Right. So dashboard is everything that you guys are tracking performance wise. It's your analytics, your reporting. Right. So here you'll see the schedule of value remaining.  Bill, Retention Pending, and Reconciliation Status at the top. For the Schedule of Value, it is calculating the total value of scheduled work for the month.  Oh, sorry, for the entire projects. Yeah. And then for the remaining to bill, this would be the calculation of your scheduled value minus the total invoices.  So it is going to be auto-calculated and is highly referenced from how accounting or Angela is tracking all the invoices and the payments.  Here. And for the total retention pending, so there is, later on you'll see that in the job card itself, but there is a specific field in the schedule of value that is for the retention.  So for the retention amount for all of the projects, it's calculating that here does we have the total retention pending.  This is how much we're still looking forward to bill the client for. And then the reconciliation status, this is for accounting here and for Chris here to check the reconciliation status based on the completed contracts and cleared payments in each job cards.  There's the monthly revenue trend which should show you how much your actual revenue versus the forecasted revenue right here, how much you guys have been doing for August, September.  So this is a timeline per se each month that should show you your monthly revenue trend. And then the job status description, remember that we were able to come up with different stage names.  So we've got the got job stage, the get ready stage, executions, and removal stage. So how many we are tracking in the got job and the get.  So this is like a vision of where you guys are most at in terms of completing the projects. The moment I can see the way that I interpret this chart is that you guys have two gut jobs that are probably taking a while to finish the utility setups or hookups or compliance.  And then the get ready, probably this one is sitting in the get ready phase because you guys are still working on creating the work orders or maybe the schedule of values is still being created by Angela.  Right. Okay, so I'm going to stop there. So far, do you have any questions, Wayne? No, not currently.

5:51 - Wayne McCoy
  Not here. So Fiona, I do.

5:54 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  you. And I guess I assumed, which is a bad thing when we talked about this. Last week. So the checks and balance for everything we do, not so much for Wayne, but for the company, the schedule of values, is that all time?  So the number one box, Angela, is that of all time or will there be a this year? Right. So $725,000.  Then, you know, what is that? Is it all time or is it a year? And then the remaining is, well, remaining is what it is.  It's of all time. This is all the revenue that you still could go out and get. So, yes, all time.  It's all time. So that number is going to grow to the multi. I mean, is there ever a default or does that number go away when the.
  ACTION ITEM: Remove archived jobs from dashboard metrics (SOV, retention, reconciliation) - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=415.9999  So job goes into the archive stage? Archive stage, yes, correct.

7:06 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So we will eliminate the calculation of all archive to the schedule of value because that's already a completed job, right?  Yeah, so it will always...

7:18 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  I'm sorry, go ahead.

7:20 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yeah, sorry, I think you're almost going to say what I was trying to say. Okay, perfect.

7:26 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Then that's great. And then retention, again, is part of the schedule of values, right? Yes. It has a line on the schedule of values.  And then the reconciliation status is jobs with completed contracts and cleared payments. Exactly. So of the six jobs that make up that $725,000, three are complete.  All right. That three number comes off there when it goes into archive? Yes, that's right.

8:00 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So I think there is still like that little gap or a little time that Angela still has to make sure that she's cleared everything first before we archive the job.  Okay.

8:12 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  I just want for Mike, so that I'm clear, but then also so Wayne understands why that's up there. It's really going to be the nice checks and balance.  Okay. Yes.

8:25 - Wayne McCoy
  And I guess maybe just to ask the question for that, for a completed job, that means the job's completed.  We've picked up our material and all that stuff and whatever billing needs to be billed has been billed and the job is closed.  That is correct.

8:44 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So literally when the job is closed, nothing is pending anymore. We already have sent the final invoices and Angela has made the final reconciliation.  Got it. Yeah.

8:58 - Wayne McCoy
  And closed doesn't...

9:00 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Archived, just for clarity. So closed is still going to be in these numbers here because the payment maybe hasn't cleared or something, but once the job is completely done, we've collected the payment, there is no collections efforts, there's nothing else, it's good, and it goes in archived, then the value comes out of scheduled value and comes off the reconciliation status because now it's archived.  It has nothing to do with what we're working on. Got it. Exactly. Great. Thank you. All right. Now moving on to the next chart here or graph.

9:33 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So we do have the contract amount versus build, right? So this is filtered or could be filtered per project.  So it's going to show you the last or the most recent job created here, the six projects at least that are most recent.  Again, it should show by default, but you can definitely just, if you want to just look at, you know, four of it.  Then you can just see four of it, just to have like an apples to apples or comparison here. Or if you just want to look at one project, you know, and see how's the contract amount versus build look like, right?  And then you can definitely do that here. Right, so that's the idea of the contract amount versus build graph.  Then we do have a section for deposit alerts. So any projects or jobs that we are still waiting for deposits are going to be flagged here.  And remember, we are applying the red tag status so that we wouldn't be able to create work orders unless this red tag is removed by accounting or compliance team.  Right, so you should know that like right here, downtown office complex, for example, and medical center renovation, they do have deposit alerts and we really couldn't do anything until you, just  they paid for that deposit right and then the recent work orders anything that just you know created in the system are going to show here as the recent work orders so you would so whoever is manning or owning the work orders which would be you yourself Wayne should see up here which ones you just recently sent out to the crew or you've created sorry great so yeah then I can definitely move on to the next part of this if you don't have any questions is this just a general interface or is this the like per opportunity this is just a general interface or just okay yes great and then this recent work orders are are all all  Work Orders regardless of where projects or where job they came from yeah but if you want to look at the you know because if you click this one it should show you as well the work orders where it is related and if you want to check on the specific job its parent job is right here but I'm gonna go through that yeah but that's the dashboard do you have any questions so far Wayne or maybe additional questions Chris no currently all right let's move on to the jobs okay so this is um this is your entire jobs pipeline where we created the different stages for for contracts or for um parent job right uh and the way that it is working right now is it fetches data from Salesforce so Jacob here is working on the back end um he already have done that um he uh  So for every GotJob email that you guys receive, it's automatically going to create a job card here in the GotJob stage with fetch data from Salesforce.  So I'll show you what those fetch data are. So it should show in the sales summary. So it's already going to identify what the project type is, its contract amount based in whatever is written in Salesforce, if mobilization fee is required, the start date, any description from sales here, its location, the project manager, it can be automatically assigned to you, or we can remove you to be an auto-assigned person here for a project manager, and the sales hand of notes is going to be captured as soon as a GotJob email is received by the internal team.  So this is all automatically pulled. From Salesforce?

14:01 - Wayne McCoy
  Correct. Yes. Awesome. Cool.

14:03 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Once it's up, the stuff that's already in there isn't automatically coming over. Yes. Whatever you're seeing here are just dummy information too.  Sure.

14:14 - Wayne McCoy
  Sure. Yeah. Wow. Yes. We're already on it, Swain.

14:20 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So that's just the, you know, just the start of the implementation here for the sales summary. That's auto-fetched or auto-pulled from Salesforce.  So we have made that progress already, but I'm going to walk you through different sections and buttons here inside the job card.  So again, let me just go back to the pipeline. So we have Got Job Stage, Get Ready Stage, Execution, Maintenance, Removal, and Archived, right?  So for the Got Job, of course, we know that this is the start of the project, right? It should show you the name of the project.  So we're going to name it accordingly. And and Then, you know, who's our customer here? So if this is our customer, ABC Construction, then that's our customer's name right here.  Its stage is also here. If you want to export it as a PDF, you can export it as a PDF if you want to have like a paper trailer or something, a paper record somewhere.  And then the Edit Job button. So Edit Job is what you click if you want to edit basic information about the project, like the job title, the client, the status.  Who the project manager would be, the start date, location, description, and notes, similar to what we see in the sales summary.  Then the project type, contract amount, deposit amount, mobilization. If mobilization fee is required, you can check or uncheck this.  Any sales handoff notes, know, definitely Jeff can make edits here for any sales handoff. Even if it is not, you know, something available in Salesforce, you can make edits here as well.  phone! reviewers. us going this And the Preliminary Material List. He can definitely upload the Preliminary Material List here, which is something important to you, Wayne.  Then Contracts. So again, if for example, Sandra here would like to make changes with the contract information, it's all here.  Billing References as well, whatever the billed preference of the client is. Based on the contract, I think it should be available in the contract.  She should just write it here. Payment Status also is up here. And if the contract is completed or executed, she can just mark this check or unchecked.  Pre-Lean Status, if it is pending, not required, or filed. If, for example, this is where the Service Suspension red tag is manipulated.  So if she checks this out, then the red tag alert is gonna appear at top of the job card and will also appear.  in the dashboard, right? And then the deposit invoice number for the service suspension to be removed or to be like checked, audited by, oh sorry, accounting or Angela here, right?  And then the permits. So permits here, this is where you coordinate with iPermit people as well as Jeff here and Wayne are co-owning the permit section as far as we process engineered that.  So permit status here, different status of the permit, permit number if it is available, utility company, whatever utility company we signed up for, what's the utility coordination status if we have submitted the application, service verified, or just awaiting connection, and the iPermit link right here.  With the iPermit link, this is something that you guys should manually just enter because I don't think I'm great person, for  That is generated when a GotJob card is automatically pulled from Salesforce. I don't think the iPermit link is something available already at the first start of the GotJob phase.  All right. So, so far, do you have questions?

18:21 - Wayne McCoy
  Is that an assumption or a question? I think that's an assumption, but you can correct me if I'm wrong.  So, yeah, generally when Jeff sends a GotJob, he has that submission already completed if it requires one.

18:36 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Okay.

18:37 - Wayne McCoy
  I would say if that's something that can be pushed over, I think that'd be great. That way there's no double doing anything.

18:46 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yes.

18:46 - Wayne McCoy
  Yates, tell me to stop if I'm asking too many questions. No, I was going to ask for clarification afterwards.

18:53 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  words, I thought that that iPermit link was being brought over from Salesforce. course. No. Are you saying it's not right now?

19:02 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  No, not right now as far as I know. Jacob, we're able to confirm that.

19:08 - Cob Bautista
  Well, actually, we can definitely pull that IPERMIT link. So the trigger for the GotJob to populate with the data coming from Salesforce is when that Salesforce deal was tagged to close one.  So that's the trigger. So when that deal or opportunity was tagged to close one, then that will be the time that it will trigger the synchronization from Salesforce to the CRM.  So what we can do is all of the available data on the Salesforce, let's say on the Salesforce field, on the right-hand side of the Salesforce, we can definitely make that available on each of the job card that we have here.  So for the IPERMIT link, if you guys will let me know what field... Is it called on Salesforce? I can definitely pull that out, include that on the trigger so that when an opportunity is closed, one, that all of the available data on that deal, we can definitely have it available on the CRM.  Okay.

20:20 - Wayne McCoy
  And the next question I would have, and this is something that Jeff initiates for the most part, but I'm the one that pretty much manages from the point of the handoff, if you will.  There's a lot of material or information or fields, if you will, that are on the permit side for what we're currently using for Salesforce that is not on your guys' card.  For instance, like for the permit portion of it, I see the permit number. But there's a lot of information that's not, like dig alert numbers, expiration date for the dig alert, inspection dates for the permit, release dates for the permit, utility company I see on here, but there's no field for when we instigate the utility application, account information, application IDs, and all that jazz, which is super, super important.  I don't know if you want to see my screen, if you need to see that, or if that's, I don't know where we're at as far as that goes, but.

21:46 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yeah, that's a good thing that you mentioned that, because yes, we can definitely add those fields up, yeah, and we can fetch the data from Salesforce, if that's available from the get-go.  So, with regards to sharing your screen, Yes, you could definitely share your screen, but we also would want to have access to your Salesforce instead.  So that's a concern or a block from Jacob. I think this week is that what you experienced, Jacob, that you lost access to Salesforce.  Oh.

22:19 - Cob Bautista
  Yeah, I believe the account, Chris, that we've been using, Chris Yates, I'm not sure if the password was changed, but I no longer have access or wasn't able to access that anymore.  Since when? Since last week, I believe. Okay.
  ACTION ITEM: Email Fiona/Chris permit/utility fields + iPermit link name; then Jacob adds fields/sync - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=1362.9999

22:40 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So maybe separate from this, we can figure out however we did that last time. Yeah. You won't need Wayne's account credentials, because mine, I see the same thing he does.  But maybe what we do is, if Wayne, if you can take a screenshot, maybe, because it's all on think If  One tab, right? Or it's all in one opening. Just to give them a reference so that when Jacob and I get him back into Salesforce, he can see exactly what you're looking at.

23:12 - Cob Bautista
  Yeah, definitely list all the fields or data there that you guys needed to be on the CRM. Right.

23:20 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So if you could just send that screenshot to either me or Fiona, if you've got Fiona's email, or if you can send it to me and I'll send it.  And then when Jacob and I get on, then he'll be able to see it. And I think I heard you say, Jacob, before Wayne asked the question, that if it's on the closed one, everything that's on there is triggered and can be moved over.  Is that correct? Is that what I heard you say? That's correct. Okay.

23:49 - Wayne McCoy
  So I've got two emails for Fiona. A-V? That one. Hi, babes.

23:56 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Yeah. Okay.

23:58 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  You can send that to Fiona. I read that note. Thank you. That's super helpful. Those are fields that we can definitely add.  And if I'm to share my screen once again. Is there anything else that we're missing in terms of like the permit section here that you mentioned, Wayne?  Currently, that's all that I saw right away.

24:29 - Wayne McCoy
  Can you go back to contracts, please? Sorry.

24:32 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Go back to contracts. Okay. So who, can anybody check that service suspension button right there? Or is that just Sandra?  It's anybody at the moment.

24:46 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Okay. But do you want to gatekeep it to just Sandra who can apply the service suspension?

24:53 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  I would think so, yeah. Here's what I'm worried about. about. And you tell me how we're doing business here.  So I know for a fact, so Wayne and I are getting to see the landscape. And Wayne and I understand, or I understand, and I hope Wayne will understand that what you're presenting to us is a different way of approaching how we do business.  It is not a replica of what we used to do. That's not why we created this, right? So we understand that.  However, with any change, right, it's already challenging for many people. So I think that if we get triggered to where every time we do a presentation or we do our onboarding class, that we're changing this and changing that, it's going to get very confusing and it's going to make us forget the terminology and the thought process we had for correcting this in the first place.  So a long way to say, I think that as we're doing these presentations, that we should write down that.  Hey, we might want to look at, what did you call it, when we decide who gets to check that and who doesn't?  The gatekeep. Gatekeep, yeah. So gatekeeping, you know, I think that we need to be in this thing and using it for a couple weeks before we start assigning gatekeepers.  Right. Okay. Because I'd hate for us to say, yep, Sandra's the only one to do that. Okay, what if Sandra goes to Hawaii for two months?  Or what if, you know, is there, or what if Wayne's already in there, he just got off the phone with Sandra, but now Sandra's on the phone with a cuss.  So we just have to work some of those things out by doing before we, too many restrictions on us.  I agree. Yeah.

26:45 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So during the piloting stage, that's definitely the expectation, you know, like, we really wouldn't want to gatekeep this for now.  We want everybody to be able to manipulate this. But then in the future, if we want to be more strict to...  Having that service suspension, then that's a time that we can implement gatekeepers. Got it. Got it.

27:05 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  And in that same vein, you know, there might be something, I doubt it, because I think what we're going to do is, you're giving us a brief, that's great, and I'm going to shut up so we don't waste time on the brief, but then there's going to be the time where we're working it, right?  Yes. What we just have to be cautious of is, I think there needs to be clear delineation that, oh, no, this is easy.  We can turn this to a gatekeeping thing where it's just Sandra and Chris, for example. Okay. And that's within the scope of work.  But no, if you want to add all these different fields now to this thing, that's a different scope of work contractually, and we're going to have to talk about what it's going to cost to do that, right?  So there's the incidental stuff that we can do that's in this current scope of work, and then there's things that is going to cost us money and you time, so that's going to be on a different list.  Exactly. Yes.

27:54 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  But for those stuff, yeah, those very incidental stuff are like creating... Additional Fields, that's still part of your work, uh, scope of work, um, and would not anchor, you know, like, or would not trigger another project proposal or some sort of So everything that Wayne just described were things that we knew were going to be in the scope of work.

28:15 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So that's just an automatic, Jacob just couldn't do it because he didn't, he lost access to, to, to sales.  Okay. I'm going to shut up so we can keep going, but that's kind of important. Exactly.

28:25 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  And that is also the reason why we want to have you guys, or we want to offer you guys a warranty.  Because that warranty, that three-month period is your time to really check on every bugs or any issues that you're having with the CRM that we can still fix during that warranty period.  Okay. Yeah. So yeah, so yeah, stuff are all expected, um, during the piloting stage and probably contracts team or accounting, um, will have their own say as well on the things that they want to manipulate inside the job card that we can definitely next Thank you.  you, We add, especially if it is within the scope of work. Great.

29:05 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Thank you. Any other questions?

29:08 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  No, ma'am.

29:10 - Wayne McCoy
  All right. So we're moving back here to the walkthrough.

29:13 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So again, if there is a service suspension requirement, you'll see that flag here, right at the top. And if there is a change order, you know, initiated, you will also see it from here.  But I'll get back to the change order process later on. Right. Because that's a whole other process. But again, if there is a change order triggered inside this parent job, then you should show it up front here at the top.  Right. Then we do have the timeline and notes here. It's just like a trail or a timestamp of everything that's completed so far and any additional notes as well here that is auto-generated.  So EI will let you know right now. Now, exactly where the stage is for this specific job and what additional information are we waiting for to move this to the next stage.  So that's the Timeline and Notes section. Then I already have told you about the Sales Summary section. Again, that is automatically filled out during the fetching of the data or pulling of the data from Salesforce to the CRM.  And then there's this button here, the Change Order button here, which is that process that I'm talking about. So if there is a particular opportunity for us to change the order, that is going to affect the contract amount and the entire scope of work.  So that is another button to initiate here. So when someone, whoever is creating that change order, if he clicks that button, should allow him to create the  The Change Order Title, Its Urgency Level, Is It Critical, High, or Standard? The Change Scope Description, so again, all that person has to do is to describe what is the need for the change order and its impact on the schedule or cost.  And then Estimated Material or Equipment Lists, he or she can list it down here, Estimated Change Order Account, and then Additional or Affected Places or Work Orders.  So whatever is the work order that is in here that's created already, they can just select it right here.  If it's affecting two work orders at the moment, then they can select the work orders that's affected. If none of them are actually or just one of them is just affected, then they can just select one or none.  And then there is Cancel Bot if you just want to cancel this creation. Save Draft or you just want to save this draft, you don't want to technically submit.  It's for approval yet. And then submit for approval. Then if whoever is creating this change order request, if he submits for approval, then it goes straight to Chris.  It's going to assign a task to Chris to review this change order request and then approve. So Chris, it's your responsibility as well to approve the COR or whoever is responsible for the change order approval.  Okay.

32:27 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So Fiona, this is, this is if the change order or addition comes from the technicians or from the field, right?  So, go ahead. Sorry.

32:41 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Can you repeat the question?

32:43 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Well, it's, so, so it goes back to our conversation, very confusing conversation on what, what is the definition of a change order and where is it done?  So before we get to the, the micro discussion of change orders. We get to today, currently, if there's a, whatever job we're on right now, if there's a change order to that job that's an additional scope of work that requires more money and, you know, totally change of work, Jeff does another got job.  So he, he does the proposal, just like he would a regular job. He does the proposal and everything, and then he launches it as a got job.  Exactly. Now, when he launches that as a got job, it's, it's a new got job that comes in here, but I don't know that we've mapped it here.  It's in Salesforce, but it, it gets tied to that master or to that parent job. I see what you're saying.  So if, if my understanding's correct, I don't understand yet what that mapping is. So if there's another got job and it.  Can you close that for a second? Yeah. So what is this job? Can you scroll up? So this downtown complex, if I'm going to put an elevator on that downtown complex, okay, it goes back to Jeff.  Jeff puts together a proposal. The customer is ABC Construction. We're adding now an elevator to the downtown office complex.  So that now becomes a change order, where now that contract for whatever the total amount is of, I don't see where that's at right now, but whatever that is, I'm just adding another $20,000 to it.  And Jacob probably saw this, but inside Salesforce, the downtown complex now has a change order for $20,000, which was added to the initial scope of work for downtown complex.  So if this is $75,000 plus the change order of $25,000. The downtown office complex for ABC Construction is now a $95,000 job.  So, I mean, I know that's how we talked about it, but I don't, I asked this question because I now see where there's this button for a change order.  So, I just want to make sure we're clear on who pushes that button and why. Hmm, I see.

35:32 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  I guess the process for triggering the change order is already set up for the change order button, but the mapping, you're right.  I think we still don't have a concrete map on how we want to, like, tie it up to the main or to the parent job, just like the parent and the child, you know, system that you're doing with Salesforce.  So, what I am trying or what I'm thinking is we create an addition. Additional section here, which we can call like additional scope of work for any approved or submitted change order and how much, you know, that additional scope of work is and all that other fields.  Did I hear someone raise their hand? I think it's Jacob. It's Jacob. Okay, Cobb.

36:21 - Cob Bautista
  Yeah, well, I just want to clear what we can do with that part there is to like if we create like a section and you guys are doing some kind of iteration on the Salesforce, Salesforce deal or opportunity.  Let's say you guys added like a new details that you want to see on the work order or the got job card and unfortunately, it's not available when you guys set the trigger to close deal because that's the trigger.  So all of the data during the time that it was tagged or moved to close deal. Those are the only data that will be added there, but what we can do is if there are new data that will be added there, then we can definitely try to make the system look, check on that data or have a trigger that any updates coming from that opportunity or project can also trigger and can make those new data available as well on the CRM.  Okay, great.

37:31 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So, and again, I'm not saying that we need to do things the way we do today. However, I do know that, and hopefully, maybe you and Jacob know a better way, but what just drove us crazy, if you're not a salesperson, the way we had this set up was just a nightmare because every got job became its own opportunity or its own job.  Even though though it's one One customer with 15, as many, I think, as we've counted as 15 or 16 different contracts for that same opportunity.  So now you're hunting and trying to figure out, okay, which poll am I picking up from here? What am I doing there?  Where's this? Where's that? Who's this? It's just crazy. So perhaps when we get to that stage, if we're not there yet, when I get Jacob back aligned with being on Salesforce, I'll show him how it works today.  And then I think what he just said will work. But this could be a showstopper for us if we can't put change orders under their respective opportunity or customer.  Right.

38:43 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yeah. So, and I think it's also a good thing that we discuss it right now because we can definitely implement that section or we can, you know, create that specific session for additional scope of work with its respective amount per contract.  or let's say for the child contract amount, and that should like add or sum up to the contract amount here to the parent job.  Okay, good, good.

39:09 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Yeah. That's right.

39:11 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  And then continuously, you know, calculating how much we have billed this project for, how much we're still up to bill, right?  So the same, the same like logic.

39:23 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Thank you. Awesome.

39:26 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Any other things that, you know, that just came up today that, oops, we don't have it yet? I think Wayne had, had something.

39:35 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Okay.

39:35 - Wayne McCoy
  Well, I want to talk, but I don't want to talk because I don't want to take up time and I, I don't want to confuse what you guys are already doing and stuff like that.  Because as Yates was alluding to, the way that we were using Salesforce is not what Salesforce was intended for.  Were you, we were using it, hypothetically speaking, as kind of like a sales portal as well as CRM. tuned.  Ready. Which Salesforce is not. And every time a job was created and then we had to set up a new change order, if you will, it was set up as a new job.  Yeah. And got job and everything else, which for me, I'm pretty simple minded. That made absolutely no sense to me.  Everything should be, in my mind, everything should be created within the same opportunity, which what you're showing in your interface sounds like that'd be a super awesome way to be able to do it because that confines it to that opportunity.  But the problem I think that the sales were having is that they had no way of being able to record how much money that they were creating within this within the same job.  Which... Which... Ultimately, led to 20 million got jobs, where the 20 million got jobs were, most of them were on the same actual job itself or opportunity.
  ACTION ITEM: Design CO/Additional Scope section + SOV mapping; present to Chris/Wayne next session - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=2476.9999  So my question is, how in the hell is that going to work? Because if we bring all that same confusion to this, is that going to make it more confusing?
  ACTION ITEM: Design CO/Additional Scope section + SOV mapping; present to Chris/Wayne next session - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=2476.9999

41:27 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yeah, so we'll try to create a design first on how we want to put that up here in the same job or the parent job for all additional scope of work.  But I think it's also nice for me to show you the schedule of value right here. I don't know, Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, would it be better if we just show the scope of, the additional scope of work amounts added as a schedule of value here as additional work?  Does that make sense to me to be added here in the schedule of values anyway? So theoretically, yes. The schedule of values captures that as well.

42:11 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  But which comes first, the chicken or the egg, right? So does it come from the change order that says, hey, we got more work for, I already forgot this complex.  We got more work for this complex, $20,000 worth of new work. Here's the contract stipulations. Here's the material list.  Here's all the detail for this additional $20,000. Angela, make sure this is added to the schedule of values. So, or is it that, because at the end of the day, the schedule of values, the way I see it, is something that happens afterwards.  So that the contract is in there. You if you go up where the contract, if you can scroll up.  So, and is, go Jacob, I think, explained it very well, or at least I understood it very well. So the contract PO, so if there's six change orders to this complex, am I going to see six different contracts or POs, change orders, all under there, right?  And then that $125,000, if it's got six change orders worth of $100,000, how do we capture that? Yes, it'll be on the schedule of values, but how does that get communicated, right?  Because the value for sure has to increase there. We know that because, no, this job is $225,000, not $125,000.  The breakout will be delineated in the schedule of values, but it's be very misleading if, number one, the got job is what triggers us all to say, hey, there's more work here.  But That work is different than the previous work that we did for this complex. So it's got a different contract.  It may have a different deposit amount. It certainly has a different monetary amount for the schedule of values. So I just don't know how to answer that question.  It seems like the trail that we were on that says it comes from sales logics or Salesforce that says, oh, we got an opportunity.  This new job is tucked under the complex. How do we do that? But you may have a better way.  It sounds like Jacob had a better way where we don't have to do all that clowning around business. We can do something else.

44:41 - Cob Bautista
  But yeah, we can definitely go multiple options here to implement that. The first option is to, if you, Fiona, can you hover on the bottom of the job card?  Yeah. So we can put a section somewhere there, like updates. Then we. We can add a button on that.  So once we click that button, it will scan the closed one opportunity if there are added jobs or work orders under that project.  So you can just click that refresh button or we can add a new trigger. So this new trigger is if anything is created, related to that job or related to that opportunity and they have like the same reference ID, then the system can try to detect that like, hey, I detected that there are new updates associated with this card or with this project.  Then it will, so it will fire a trigger, then what will happen on the backend Salesforce, it will talk to Salesforce, like, hey, what's the new update?  Then Salesforce will provide those data, then we can definitely display those data. Around there somewhere in that section or in that cloud.  Okay.

46:06 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  And last thing I'll just say about it too is maybe the way to backtrack in how this is done is if you go back to the dashboard, right, and the data that fills in that schedule of value, that total amount, is it the got job or does it pull from the got jobs or does it pull from the schedule of values?  I'm guessing it's pulling from the schedule of values because how else would you know what the total retention pending and total bill remaining is, right?  Yeah. Yes, that's right. So maybe you both see, and this is why we're counting on you guys a little bit.  Theoretically, I get what all this is, but systematically, I don't. If the schedule of values was to drive those numbers to avoid redundancies and overestimating or underestimating what the true value of something is, then maybe...  Fiona, what you were alluding to is it's all driven by the schedule of values. But if it's driven by the schedule of values, we go back to what Jacob's talking about.  Okay, well, how do we get that knowledge put in without doing a got job? Yeah.

47:20 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So at the moment, I don't have the best approach that we can try. I'll try to design first. I'll collaborate.  with Jacob and how we can best show that here inside the got job. So it's mapped properly and it's calculating the schedule of value correctly here.  And maybe in our next session, then we can like show that to you and let us know, you know, if that's something that resolves the problem or the concern or it's or there's a better way or there's a better way.  So I think we're going to schedule for me to get Jacob back in this.

47:59 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Thank Salesforce, right? So we're going to do that. And I think when we do that, if we can just set 15 or 20 minutes aside to where I can show them what our thought process was, that way when you look at it, at least you'll know where this, the abortion started.  Yeah, that's like a plan. Okay. Yeah, sure. Would you like to do that now?

48:19 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  I mean, because we're already almost on top of the hour here. I don't want to waste Wayne's time.
  ACTION ITEM: Schedule 15–20 min SF access session w/ Chris + Jacob - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=2902.9999

48:25 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  We can, but that may take some time, and I don't want to waste Wayne's time, anybody's time. Maybe if me and Jacob do a separate 15-minute meeting somehow, we're not wasting your time or Wayne's time or Mark's time?  Because we still have a little bit more to show Wayne, right? Yes, there are more.

48:47 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So we're definitely okay to extend here, just to finish everything that we need to finish. And I'll just continue with what's showing here.  If it is okay as well, I'll try to... Skip some of the things or like sections here that are not too much related with Vain, if that's okay.

49:07 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Yeah.

49:08 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So anyway, we will have you access it and so you can like play around it and maybe if you have a feedback, you can let us know right away or wait until our next session so you can deliver those feedback to us.  Okay. Yeah. So and then there's definitely your accounting and deposit section that's for Angela and the contracts and compliance section that's for Sandra.  Permits and utilities again will come up or we will add more fields here that are necessary for us to track here in the permits and utilities.  This task management section is your task management, right? There is, um, there are automated tasks that are assigned to you by the system, but also you can definitely manually add a task here that you identify for yourself or for another person, right?  You can add a task title, description, status assigned to, priority due dates, and the comment section here is just really, you know, if, for example, me, I do have a question to the task that you assigned to me, then I can comment that here, and we can, like, have a coordination inside this task so we can progress or we can complete it, right?  And then, yeah, so it's also going to show you all of the tasks that are not started, all of the tasks that are in progress, completed, or blocked at the moment, okay?  So that's a task management here. Change order tracking, so this is the section where we want to track the change order.  This was just newly implemented, Chris, this wasn't available from our last meeting, so just like this one, yeah, so I guess this is probably one way or one approach that we want to maybe take a look at to map all  We'll to change order inside the parent job but we'll definitely take a look at that and then schedule of value this is something Angela is going to work on as soon as she receives the got job basically you'll see here every contract value we're tracking including the retention and like automatic calculations here about total schedule value specific for this job remaining to bill and the retention pending is right here as well.

51:33 - Wayne McCoy
  Wow, so we'll be able to see kind of in real time what what's been paid what in our work orders turning into invoices what's been paid what's amazing.  Yes, that's right.

51:50 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  And so it's also a high coordination between you and Angela especially if you guys are tracking down payments. You know, you can add your phaser another row.  So, with another value here, and that's going to calculate the remaining two bill and the total billed so far.  Perfect. Our total input so far. Yes. So, that's the schedule of value there.

52:15 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Fiona, just so you and Jacob know how valuable this is to us, and not that Angela was trying to hide things from us, but we never see this unless we specific ask for it, and she'll give it to us.  But this is on her computer, not even in a shared file, so we never really know the status without digging or asking.  So, that's why we're excited about this feature. So, to both of you, thank you so much for bringing that to fruition for us.  But go ahead. It brings so much stuff to light to be able to see everything in full time on job.

52:52 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yes. Nice to meet you. And you know what else it fixes, Wayne, is the whole, well, how do we forecast?

52:59 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  You know, the whole whole thing. That you pointed out a couple weeks ago. Well, no, dummy. You just put it in service suspension.  So now it's not counted towards, you know, forecasted work to be done. Yeah. This fixes all that. Oh, anyway, go ahead.  We're just excited about this. Very. All right.

53:17 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So that's for the Schedule of Values. We're so happy to hear all your feedback, positive feedback. And we'll, we'll, of course, make sure to upgrade this to your fitting, your, your system fitting, operation fitting, right?  Next, materials and work order builder. This is, again, going to be used highly by Wayne and Mark here because they will be coordinating together.  So I've put here a legend of what it means when we say ready, needs to order, and procured or on order, right?  This is where you would add the materials that, that you would need Wayne for a specific work order. Then we already have.  So added the work order that this, for example, this equipment is included in, right? So this just newly implemented.  So it should show you, boom, the work order where this material is needed. Oops, sorry, let me go back.  And then, like how many, how much do we need? When it is needed by any documents or ETA or PO.  This is a comment section, you know, if you want to talk about, specifically about this, this equipment or material with Mark.  Edit, if you want to edit it, it's right here. You can do that.

54:42 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  You can upload a PO receipt or document.

54:45 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  And then delete it, of course. If you want to add material, again, you can do that just by clicking that button.  And that's it. So that's for the material and work order builder. There is a section.

55:03 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

55:05 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  No, you're fine. Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead.

55:10 - Wayne McCoy
  This is for a particular job, right? Yes. So, for instance, I'm not quite sure, but to be had at a later date, I'm sure, but for material equipment, you're saying we need a 165 KWE generator.  That's what needs to be ordered and whatnot for this particular job. Is there a collective of things that, like, say we need to order that we could compile collectively with all jobs?

55:48 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  I don't think we have that some warehouse, right, Marky? We really have not, like, collectively for all jobs.

56:00 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So it may, I think when you get to the work order calendar, I think it may not answer your question, Wayne, but it's going to show you, okay, Mark's going to see, okay, on the 4th, I've got, there's only one job there now, but there's going to be, you know, six squares for six jobs that day.  So he's got to prep for that day. Go ahead, Mark. Sorry, sorry.

56:30 - Mark Jalandoni
  Chris, could you click billing schedule, Fiona, so Chris can see that, like for that day, like February 4th, if you click that, it would show all the work orders for that day.  Yeah.

56:49 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  But as far as the material list he's talking, how does he see for that day all the materials that are prepared for his day?  Because right now he can see it. by job but he can't see it by day or week for that matter.

57:05 - Mark Jalandoni
  Yeah, you guys need to click on it.

57:10 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yeah, so at the moment it's just really, yeah, you're gonna have to go back to the job card and figure out from here the need by date.  I guess we can create a filter or maybe another section right here in the work order calendar where where in just one day you'll see the different materials that are needed for the date, if that makes sense.  I think that's what you're looking for, Wayne, correct me if I'm wrong.

57:41 - Wayne McCoy
  Yeah, and I think maybe it's just my terminology, maybe a report or something. And the only reason why I'm asking, which has certainly nothing to do with you guys, but, you know, trying to get something that's, because I'm sure this.  We'll be very user-friendly, but to some people, having to go through 20 different steps just to find out what material needs to be ordered type of thing, vice having a report that they can just pull and say, hey, this is the material that's needed for that day, not having to go to every job type of thing.  And collectively, you know, this is the material that's needed for February 12th. This is the material that's needed for February 13th or what have you.  Is that something that's doable? And I'm just going to look for our shop manager and his people to where they can be able to pull those hypothetical reports and say, yep, this is the material that we have to order.
  ACTION ITEM: Build daily/weekly materials-needed report for Mark - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=3514.9999  I see what you're saying.

58:45 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  And to answer your question shortly, that is, yes, doable. We can create a filter or a reporting system here where, you know, Mark or the shop manager can just look at.  about Thank Every day, what needs to be ordered for a specific job or for a specific work order. All that lists are going to be in there.  So we can filter it, especially if, for example, you add a material here and you make sure that you have a need by date here, I think is what's going to make that report comprehensive.  So you have something to pull from.

59:25 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Yeah, so a daily or weekly view of the materials list. And we can show you again quickly, if you need to see it, what we're using, what Wayne created in Notes now, where it just gives you, it gives them a whole weekly or actually gives them a whole month.  Here's all the jobs that I'm doing. Here's what I'm doing, the jobs. Mark, are we in sync? Do I have these materials ready for me on this day?  Yes or no? So now everything else you're showing is beautiful, right? It's actually better than what we're doing today because it says, hey, it's on order or it's ready to go.  So, that part's cool. But I think we need to talk about the day and weekly view or monthly view of the materials list as a collaborative for all jobs being done this week or this day or this month.  Got it. Mark or anybody in Mark's position will go crazy if I got to open all these little bubbles every day to find out what I need for today for three weeks out.  Mark. Mark.

1:00:29 - Wayne McCoy
  I can say as far as information goes, I think this is absolutely amazing because it gives more information than we've ever been able to acquire, being able to, you know, hey, this job is for customer code, blah, blah, blah, and has all the information.  But if that information can be compiled as a report to where they can be able to view that within the day, week, and month would be huge to where they can pull from whatever they need to.  But, you know. If something's completed, they can, you know, tap on it or whatever and it's a done deal because I think that'd just be very, for me, looking outside, looking in, very confusing for someone to try to find out what's what because their focus is material.  Their focus not necessarily is the job, it's the material or equipment.

1:01:20 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Correct. That's really for ease of reference for Mark there to have that kind of report ready for him to just look at to start to the start of his day, right?  I got you. We can get that implemented, yeah. As long as the, you know, the data fields or triggers are available within the system itself, we can definitely do that.  All right. And then there's like a material coordination log here, specifically if want to talk about, like, out of the material, let's say, specific material conversation.  you. Thank So like have that conversation here with the shop manager right here. So, so far any questions with the materials and work order besides the material list report that we're aiming to have?

1:02:17 - Wayne McCoy
  When you guys were talking about the whole when a got job is sent, that information is pulled from Salesforce into the CRM.  Yes. Material wise, would that be something similar? Because everything that's created is created in Salesforce from Jeff, the salesman, to include line items with all the material and all that stuff.  Is that something that would be, information would be pulled and drug into this material builder or is that going to be manually done?

1:02:53 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Um, if that is already an information or data that is available in Salesforce again, and- . I'm just repeating what Cobb mentioned earlier.  Cobb, correct me if I'm wrong. If that is available, we can pick that up. We can patch that data, right?  He says yes, 100%. Okay, good.

1:03:13 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  But to be fair, to be fair, it's not, excuse my ignorance here, but it's not data port to data port.  Wayne, in SalesLogix, the material list is actually an Excel doc, right? When you want to put it in notes, where do you get the information from when you put it in notes?  From Jeff's equipment list. But is it like a, is it a Salesforce formatted thing or is it an Excel attachment?

1:03:49 - Wayne McCoy
  How he creates it, and we'd almost have to have Jeff on here because he's the one that builds these equipment lists based on the...  I quotation, if you will, but I'm sure that all that stuff is basically a drop-down in Salesforce is how he creates the equipment list.  From there, he creates a PDF based on that information. I know that he doesn't hand-type all that stuff in.  Okay, thanks.

1:04:24 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Okay.

1:04:25 - Wayne McCoy
  So I think that would probably be one thing that would be a question for me is there's got to be, for Jeff, an equipment list and drop-downs that he's able to pull information from that I would assume would be drug into here.  That way, if, you know, whether it be change orders or whatever the case is, there's drop-downs from equipment that we have.  Instead of having to manually type all that stuff in. Which is the list I sent you, Fiona.

1:04:56 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Not the drop-down, obviously, but the list that I sent you, that's the materials. Got it. Okay, I see.

1:05:03 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So which one are you referring to when you create the work orders, Wayne? Is that the PDF version of it or the drop-downs or the fields in Salesforce?

1:05:19 - Wayne McCoy
  Well, that's a completely loaded question because, and I don't know if we need to get into it right now or whatever, tell me to stop if I need to.  So Jeff sends a got job. Say that got job requires a 200 app main, five poles, 500 feet of number two wire.  We'll just leave it at that for now. That material is provided by Jeff Clark with an equipment list that's paralleled basically with the quotation.  With that material, depending upon what that job requires as far as us to instigate the process. Project, once the permit's obtained anything else, then I set up a work order based on the schedule of work that we're doing for that day.  If it's just for that day that all we can do is set the meter pole, then that work order is only going to have basically a meter pole on it, a 200 at main.  So I guess the question would be, is initially, is there going to be, and I'm asking the question because I have no idea, initially, is there going to be a pole from that initial quotation or proposal that Jeff provides us and is going to have all that equipment list?  And basically, in my mind, I'm thinking, oh, here's the equipment list, I'm just going to start tapping what we need for that day, and would be pulled into a work order.  Is that what your guys' thought is?

1:07:03 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  I don't.

1:07:07 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yeah, you're saying something, Chris. Well, so, yeah, we're opening Pandora's box.

1:07:13 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So because I saw it very differently. What I saw was the work orders now might have notes on the bottom of certain things that need to be done.  But it's not a, it's not a, each line has a list of take two of these, three of these, six of those, right?  Because our proposals are scope of work proposals. And we actually do that for a reason, because we don't want to get into the itemizing.  The itemizing has nothing to do with the work order, per se, because that's a scope of work. The itemizing has everything to do with procurement.  So, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but we don't ever do that on the work order. So the work order doesn't have, I need two of these, three.  We these for a total of $5,000. It has a scope of work. The line-by-line stuff is the materials list to Mark, from Wayne, to Mark that says, hey, for me to do this scope of work, I need this many of these things.  And then Mark goes back up here and says, okay, this is ready. I got this. This is ready. This is ready.  Oops, I got to procure this. And then he can upload the, he could even upload the document, right, the PO that says, this is how much it's going to cost for you to do this.  So I think, Wayne, from a, from, we didn't, we didn't fix it for it to be on the work order that way, but what you explained is what we want to do for this part, for the materials list.  Yeah. Right? So, so that's, that's what we need to pull over. If it is, in fact, the list that I sent you, Fiona, where it's drop-downs in Salesforce, programmed into Salesforce.  Then I think Cobb says, yeah, 100%, we can data that over to the CRM. I don't believe it is.  I hope I'm wrong. But we'll find out tomorrow morning for sure. Yes.

1:09:15 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  At first, I thought it was just a generic, or not a generic, but at first, I thought it was just a link to a Google Sheet or an Excel Sheet with all of the materials lists.  That's why in the preliminary material list section here, it was just a link to that PDF. Right. Yeah. So if there are fields available that are just, you know, Jeff is choosing from, like that drop-downs, and can be taken from Salesforce and updated here or migrated here in CRM, then definitely we can do that and just maybe rename the preliminary materials to coded materials or what in the...  During the sales closing, right? So we can put that here. I think it's still something that we can do if, again, those information are available in Salesforce.  Yeah. Anything else?

1:10:19 - Wayne McCoy
  I'll shut up for now.

1:10:22 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yeah, but you're actually on it. This is exactly what we're looking for when we want to do the piloting stage.  You give us your feedback just so we make sure that this CRM is useful to you. It's easy for you to use, and it's eliminating a lot of, you know, confusions and issues that you have at the moment with your current setup.  Yeah. So that was Jeff. And, yes, they are drop-down fields.

1:10:53 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So everything that's on that list was put into Salesforce, has it, and he just drops it down. and adds it into his materials list.  So it is a field. So if it's a field that Cobb can work with, then I think the answer of 100%, yeah, we can move this over to CRM, clears up that problem, Wayne.  Yeah.

1:11:15 - Wayne McCoy
  And then just to confirm, and I get, like I said, you know, I know Jeff just came back off vacation, all that kind of stuff, whatever, but every, not every, 99% of all jobs that Jeff is awarded, um, he, he builds, and this is just how he does it, um, currently, um, but he builds a proposal, but from that proposal, it's like you were mentioning, it's a scope of work, but outside of that scope of work, he builds an equipment list, um, that we use, that way I can see exactly what material you need and all that stuff, whatever, and that's what I was talking about, because, um, depending on what the job is,  I pull that equipment list, and then for that particular day that we need to actually do the work, I'm pulling from that equipment list to give to Mark, hey, this is what we need.  Do we have a material? Do we need to order it? So we're saying the same thing. So scope of work is outside talk.

1:12:18 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Materials list is inside talk. Great. Yeah. That's good news. Based on what Jacob said. Yes. Yeah. So we're really highly depending on Jacob here and his magic.  No pressure, Jacob, if you're still there. No pressure.

1:12:43 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Love you. Love you. We'll definitely make sure that you do have access in Salesforce today because we need to get those all displayed here right away.  Okay. Thanks, Cobb. No pressure. Sure. So next, work order section. So this work order section is where you create work.  than See Orders and Extras. And we already have defined the difference between Change Order and Extras, right? And of course, the typical work order that we create, that is part of this local burger schedule of value here.  So in here, you'll see all of the regular work orders down here, and then the extras as well. If you'll see extra, or if you've created extra, it should show here.  And you will have an extra count here as well, if you add one. So let's say you want to add a work order.  This is how it's going to look like. So when you add a work order, it will automatically generate a work order number, but you're going to have to nominate a work order title.  And then assign crews here is what you would create, right? You are going to assign crews. So creating a new crew, of course, you're going to have to name your first crew.  Let's say, I just want to say first. And I want to add this crew, right? And then you'll see in the assigned crew that you do have one crew that you need to assign crew members to, right?  So for example, I want to assign Marcus here for my first crew, and then Sarah and David. And then I want to add another crew for the same work order.  So let's say second crew. I want to add that up. And it should show here as well as the second crew.  And I can add more people here. Let's say I just want to add two people for the second crew.  Now you do have two crews in the same work order, right? With all their different credentials and titles showing up here.  So it's easy for you to select, um, a specific crew member that are also available. Then, um, once you're, you're done creating crews and assigning crew members to the crew, then you can select...  Collect the date, the start time, the end time, and the end date, and then the duration, schedule of value, like how much we're projecting this to be billed for, the customer contact information, the sitemap link, which is a Google map link that you can paste here, the scope of work, and any safety notes or special instruction, and then you can create the work order.  Right? I have question. Yes, go ahead.

1:15:32 - Wayne McCoy
  So, cool on the cruise, then after I complete this, can I manipulate those crews after the fact, if I need to?  Yes, you could still. And then secondly, can you go back to that? Oh, sorry.

1:15:56 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Thank you for coming back.

1:16:01 - Wayne McCoy
  So whatever work order, like when you're creating a work order. Okay. So you're creating crews and all that stuff, whatever.  Do we, something that I think would be great to at some point, but do we have to put a start time and end time?  Or is that something that we can leave blank?

1:16:23 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  It's really up to you. Is that something you need to have there?

1:16:26 - Wayne McCoy
  Or it'd be great for us to, once we get to that point, but I don't, I can't say that that's going to be on point or if it needs to be something that I don't think that's as, as important right now.  I mean, as long as it doesn't matter to any of us, but that site map link, I think that'd be amazing.  Is that something that can be pre-populated within the job itself? Yes.

1:16:53 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  When the crews get those assignments, they should be able to pull that site map link from

1:17:01 - Wayne McCoy
  No, what I'm saying is, because I'm assuming you're saying, I have to put that sitemap link in there? Yes.  Can that be already auto-populated from the opportunity?

1:17:17 - Cob Bautista
  For that, basically, I need to check what Salesforce can offer to us, because most of the time, let's say that you have 11 fields there.  So the fields contains transaction ID, name, name of the business, so all of those fields are listed there, and there are other fields available on that Salesforce as well.  So it really depends on what Salesforce can really share to us, but the bottom line is, there are data that Salesforce doesn't allow, but we do have a workaround on how to get that data.  So, what I'm going to do, what's, I got reconnected to Salesforce... First of will cross-reference the data that I can see or I can transmit from Salesforce to the CRM based on what Fiona listed because I believe Fiona is taking notes of all the data that you guys want to be added there.  So, yeah, that will be the plan. So the plan is once Fiona sent all those data to me, I'll cross-reference it to one of the sample or one of the opportunity or closed deal or closed one on the Salesforce, then we will go from there.  Gotcha.

1:18:34 - Wayne McCoy
  Yeah, as of right now, outside of addressing and stuff like that, that's in Salesforce. There is no sitemap link that we have in Salesforce.  But, so my question was, I don't think that necessarily has to be pulled from Salesforce, but for like the main, what do you guys are calling?

1:18:57 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  of the job?

1:18:59 - Wayne McCoy
  So So your interface on the whole job itself, the opportunity with all the data and all that stuff, whatever, hey, this is the main interface for that particular job.  It has most of all that information. Would that sitemap link be able to be put there? That way, when we create work orders and stuff like that, it's pulling that information.  That way, I'm not having to type all this stuff over and over and over again, because on one job, I could have 20,000 work orders.

1:19:33 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Right here. That's what you're saying, right? This location can be auto-populated.

1:19:39 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Hey, Fiona, I can just interject. I think if you go to the billing schedule and you hit a bubble and it shows everything that's in that bubble, I think that might answer his question.  So billing schedule. So where's the bubble thing where the calendar and it has like that? Okay, so that's the work order, right?  You can do a printed version. So if you tap into that, so there's the link. So, yes. Where's that coming?  Who's putting that in there? You will.

1:20:17 - Wayne McCoy
  Well, that's what I'm saying. I don't want to. Is there somewhere with that opportunity to where it's already there and it auto-populates in that work order?  Yeah, so Jacob said he's going to check that.

1:20:32 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  If that link is transferable in Salesforce, then yes. Well, in the real world, of course, that's what we want.

1:20:41 - Cob Bautista
  We don't want to put things there. It will be more efficient if it auto-populates that link. So there's still a workaround that we can do.  So what I can do here, if we cannot pull those data from Salesforce, I can just try to manually pull it.  But – Yeah. It might take additional resources because that data will be coming from Google, like Google Maps. the plan is, what I'm going to do is I will create a system or a workflow that it will capture the address that was added on the CRM.

1:21:19 - Wayne McCoy
  Yeah, so this interface that you're on right now, is there anywhere within there that we can just say, hey, this is the address to the job?  And here's an area that I can add that Google link to it manually for this interface. So you guys don't, because it's, unless you tell me otherwise, I don't think that there's anywhere in Salesforce that we're currently doing that.  But what I'm asking is, even if I have to do it manually on each job, that's not a big deal.  But being able to have that field to where it auto-populates. you ANGELA Thank It's every, all the work orders within that opportunity.  Okay. That's definitely possible.

1:22:06 - Cob Bautista
  That, I do have a question.

1:22:08 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So would the location of the job be different for work order?

1:22:16 - Wayne McCoy
  No, as long as that location that you're showing, what is that for? Is that the job name or job address?  Yeah, I think this is the job address captured in Salesforce.

1:22:30 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Okay. Yeah.

1:22:30 - Wayne McCoy
  So if that's the case, then yeah, that location, and then maybe right below that, hey, here's a Google link that you can add to it if you want to.  And then from that point, my thought is, is when you create a work order, it pulls from that information instead of always having to add that on a work order, because that sounds, sounds, like that'd be a pain in the butt if it's already within the confines of that.
  ACTION ITEM: Research Google Maps API for auto-populating sitemap links - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=4970.9999  Yeah. Okay.

1:23:01 - Cob Bautista
  With that, I can definitely do a research on how we can implement that, but I'm confident that it is possible.  So the workaround that I'm seeing here is that I will create like a separate system that captures the address.  Then once it captures the address, it will search that address in Google Map. That is why I said that it can have like additional resources because we will be tapping into Google Maps data.  So when we do that, Google Map requires like a key, what we call this is like API key. So that API key is like, you know, it is paid on their end.  So it's like giving me an opportunity to access their system's backend so that I can pull this specific data.  Let's say the address that was added on each of the work order. all So If I can you, What I can do is if the CRM detects that there's an address added on the work order, it will trigger, it will search the Google Map.  After it's searched the Google Map, the bottom line is it will return a site link that will be populated somewhere there in CRM.  Or if their permission or if their key or ATI key permits, I can do better than that. I can even, like, show the map itself if that is possible.  Yeah, if that is possible. But, you know, of course, I'll make sure to do a research on that. Then if it is possible, it's better because I can definitely not only show the site link on the work order, but also the map where it's located.

1:24:44 - Wayne McCoy
  Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, I wasn't meaning to make anything difficult. If I may sound like, it was just, I thought that if there was already information that was available from this interface, the jobs...  Yeah. Interface that you guys are on right now to be able to pull that information to a work order without me having to manually do all this stuff because having a link or what you were talking about, Cobb, you know, sounds amazing, way over my head, but having something that the guys can, you know, tap on, whether it's a link or whatever to on their phones or what have you, hey, this is where the next job is.
  ACTION ITEM: Add sitemap link field at job level; auto-populate work orders - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=5119.9999  Yes. That's what you were showing on their work.

1:25:28 - Cob Bautista
  I that was pretty cool.

1:25:30 - Mark Jalandoni
  Just to confirm, Wayne, as well, is what you're trying to do is just manually, like, put the link there, and then when you create a work order, it automatically populates the link?  Exactly.

1:25:43 - Wayne McCoy
  That's exactly what I'm talking about. Yeah.

1:25:45 - Mark Jalandoni
  If that's the case, Wayne, then that's definitely possible. We thought that you wanted us to, like, automatically detect the notification.

1:25:58 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  so. nice. No. No. No. No.

1:26:00 - Mark Jalandoni
  If you guys are going to populate it the first time, and then when you create a work order for the same opportunity that we're talking about, then it's absolutely possible to just, like when you create another work order for the same opportunity, the link will automatically be there.  That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1:26:20 - Wayne McCoy
  Okay. Sorry to cut you off, guys.

1:26:23 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  I just wanted to clarify that.

1:26:25 - Mark Jalandoni
  But yeah, thank you. Yeah.

1:26:29 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yeah. But what Cobb mentioned was certainly like a good feature to have, but for like a quick fix here, I think that's something we can do right away.  Yeah.

1:26:41 - Wayne McCoy
  What Mark was sharing is exactly what I was asking. Yeah. Just something super quick. I can manually put something within the confines of the interface of that job, and then it pulls that information for the work order.

1:26:54 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Or maybe we can put here a field for work order sites, sitemap. Thank Thank you. And then whenever, you know, Wayne creates a work order, it just captures that same sitemap link from the outside of this work order creation bubble.  Right. We can do that. Thank you. Anything else? Nope. Right. It should be good here. So, and then the similar thing is going to be happening when you create an extra work order.  It's just that extra work order is billed differently. Right. And it does have like additional, you know, notes that this is not a work order.  It is additional work that is not covered in the original scope and it will be tracked separately for billing purposes.  Right. So this is important for accounting. So it won't mess up with the schedule of value and all that stuff.  This is just an extra.

1:27:58 - Wayne McCoy
  Right. And. And. No, I. Say, for instance, our guys are on the job site. They have a work order that I gave them for scheduling.  Hey, the customer wants me to move a poll. What do want me to do? Yeah, go ahead and do it.  But by saying that, I've got to go in here, create an extra work order, and then assign that to them, and they'll have access to it?  Mm-hmm.

1:28:27 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Okay. Yes. Exactly. Right. So it's the same thing, assigning crews, you know, with a contact information, sitemap, link, scope of work, safety notes, and special instruction.  It's almost the same as creating a typical or a regular work order. Got it. Right. Now, if you want to take a look at all of the work orders that you've created.  Sorry, you do have an extra question? You might be going through it.

1:28:55 - Wayne McCoy
  So once they do the work order, I'm assuming this is all through. Do an application on their phone or something or a bill that's online or whatever?  Are they able to get a signature? How's that work? Yes, you're right.

1:29:16 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  They're going to get that. That's the reason why they have a separate log in logic in the welcome page.  There's a crew portal we want to call crew portal because that's where they will see all of the work orders assigned to them.  they can manually tap on their work orders and then get all the signatures from the customer, add notes to the work order, whatever additional work or additional materials or things they did for that particular work order.  That is another application that is they can also do on their phones. Okay. Yeah. So just come back here in the work order.  So all of the work orders created are here. So yeah, so for example, here it's now ready for field execution, oh sorry, it's now field execution complete, meaning to say it's ready to be billed, right?  Or it's ready for invoicing. And Angela is going to get an automatic task assigned to her to complete the invoicing.  Then you can definitely export this as a PDF. Let me show you how it looks like. So like right this, I can just export it as a PDF.  Right here, blah, blah, blah. Additional work, safety. So you wouldn't have to manually create the PDF and then, you know, send to Angela.  So Angela. can simply just go here in the work orders. Sorry, this is juggled like that. But in the.  Work Orders, if she sees build execution, she taps it, she'll be able to see everything that she needs to know in order to build.  And it's on her task list, right?

1:31:12 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  That's how she knows. She doesn't have to search. When he completes it, it's automatically on her task list. So you don't have to download the PDF and send it to her, put it in a folder, none of that crap.  Yes.

1:31:27 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So that's also on you, Wayne. As soon as you change the status of the work order for field execution complete, that's going to trigger a task automatically assigned to Angela to complete all necessary billing tasks for this specific order, right?  So yeah, so what's in here? Everything about the materials, anything about the safety instruction, execution notes, again, some crew notes, they'll be able to apply notes here as well, especially if they have  Um like additional work performed so this is important for you because you're gonna have to or you will be able to determine whether it needs to be logged as an extra or it's just you know uh something that an extra work performed but you do you do not want to build yeah and then the assigned crews is all gonna tied here um schedule and logistics when did they start because because in later on you'll see it anyway but inside the work order they have a button to click to start the work and then they also have a button to click to end the work so you would know exactly how much time they spent for this work order um yeah and then it's also going to capture the customer signature you should see here as well then the timeline work order created just the time stamps okay

1:33:01 - Wayne McCoy
  Few and far between, and I think it seems like it's more for Angela than anything else, but there are instances where they ask for it.  If a customer wants a copy of the work order, currently Angela creates a work order and submits that with the actual invoice.  Is that something that's needful for that? Or do we have access to that to like create a PDF of the actual work order?  Or is that the work order? That's it.

1:33:37 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Oh. It's printable.

1:33:41 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  It can be attached to the invoice itself, correct? Okay. She can download it herself.

1:33:47 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  You don't even have to do it. Like she does now, but it's right there. Okay. There we go. Yeah.

1:33:56 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So, yeah. So that's the entire work. Order here. Any other questions or future upgrades or, you know, features you want to be adding here?  Or maybe we're missing a field or section? Not that I know of right now, no.

1:34:14 - Wayne McCoy
  Awesome.

1:34:15 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Okay, so I think we're all good with every section's inside a job card. Yeah, so it's just a matter of us changing the stage and got job to get ready to execution, to removal, and to archive.  That's it. So if you don't have any questions in this part, we can move on to the work order calendar, which you saw already.  A glimpse of it, like all of the work orders specific on a particular day is going to show here, stackable, right?  And then the total work orders for February or for the month, scheduled revenue, and the total hours. Yes.

1:34:56 - Wayne McCoy
  So when you... When you're saying work orders, currently, and I'm excited for all this change. I'm just trying to wrap my brain around what we have been doing and what we're going to be doing.  So currently, we're using Salesforce as CRM. When I create a schedule for the particular job, I'm creating it through Salesforce as a task.  And through the tasks is how I'm able to view and see my scheduled work for the day, the week, and for the month, and so on and so forth.  In this, I'm doing that through work orders? You could.

1:35:49 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  You could technically just view all of the work orders here from the work order calendar. But I think what you're pertaining to is also this one.  One, this is an exact copy from... from Salesforce that we tried to build so you can definitely like filter by month or custom range here with all the different crews you know the status of the work order is it ready for execution pending review complete or approved for billing or invoiced and revenue type is it billable only or zero dollar only and here so as I've mentioned just because there's only one work order per date um but technically you can or we can expect this has a lot of work orders depending on the day so is this what you're looking for um kind of um I'd almost kind of have to show you what what we currently have okay Do you want me to show your screen Okay

1:37:12 - Wayne McCoy
  Are you guys seeing that right now? Yes. So this is what we're using currently as a schedule report type of thing.  So anything that I have scheduled, it's scheduled via a task on the opportunity, and that gives me a quick screenshot of what's going on for that day and collective.  So I'm able to see with a quick screenshot, or not really screenshot, but a quick view or report of what I have, like, say, for instance, for tomorrow, 2-11-2026.  These jobs is what I've got scheduled for tomorrow, and I'm able See that, or I'm able to scroll down through these days and see what I have.  This allows me to see in total what I have for the day, whether or not I have time to move more jobs in for that day or not.  Do we have access, availability for that to where I can see what we're doing in a particular day? Because if not that, for me, I think it'd be really hard for me to understand without having this type of report to see what available time I have for each day.  Yes.

1:38:44 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Correct me if I'm wrong, Marky, that's exactly what we copied from Salesforce to our own interface, right? That's the billable or billing schedule.

1:39:02 - Mark Jalandoni
  Yeah, I based it on the screenshot and then some notes from the previous call that wasn't present at that time.

1:39:12 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  But yeah, that's the billing schedule.

1:39:15 - Mark Jalandoni
  I guess we got a closer look today when Wayne shared his screen. So maybe we can do some polishing on that section.  And then whatever you guys want to add there, then we can improve the current billing schedule that we have.  That would make your lives easier.

1:39:41 - Wayne McCoy
  Yeah, so I guess I'm trying to wrap my brain around how am I getting to that point? Am I creating a task or am I creating a work order to get that information?  Because right now, how we're doing it, I mean, like I said, I'm open. Yeah, I based it on the screenshot and then some notes from the previous call that wasn't present at that time.  But yeah, that's the billing schedule. I guess we got a closer look today when Wayne shared his screen. So maybe we can do some polishing on that section.  And then whatever you guys want to add there, then we can improve the current billing schedule that we have.  That would make your lives easier. Yeah, so I guess I'm trying to wrap my brain around how am I getting to that point?

1:40:47 - Mark Jalandoni
  Am I creating a task or am I creating a work order to get that information? Because right now, how we're doing it, I mean, like I said, I'm open.  I'm to however things need to happen to make it beneficial for everybody, sharing information how I'm doing it now.  When I get a phone call from a customer, I go to that opportunity, I create a task and say, hey, this customer needs A, B, C, D, E, G, and I create that task.

1:41:17 - Wayne McCoy
  That way it's in our schedule, it's in our report to where I can see it, but that could be two weeks from now.

1:41:25 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So I'm not creating an actual work order at the time.

1:41:30 - Wayne McCoy
  Like I said, this is current. The only time I'm creating a work order is the day before when I'm procuring the schedule for the cruise for that next day.  So where am I putting that information? So basically how this was set up was when you create the work order, it automatically pulls that work order from the job order.

1:41:54 - Mark Jalandoni
  So that building schedule is the sum of every work order.

1:41:59 - Wayne McCoy
  through some there's is And

1:42:00 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  In our job order or the whole pipeline, so you would see there that you can filter the dates, the months, and then for example, you created a couple of work orders for tomorrow, it would automatically reflect in that section.  Okay, so it's through the work orders is how we're creating a schedule. Yes. Yes. So. is a task. Okay, so if I'm not ready to assign crews yet, because that's the question I'm also confused on, if I start creating crews and I need to change them, what are the guys able to see?  Are they able to see all this stuff or are they only going to see when it's assigned to them?  When it's assigned to them. So I can create a work order that's not assigned to anyone yet.

1:42:59 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Okay. Let me correct that. No, you wouldn't be able to create, just because looking at here, the work order must have assigned crews before you'll be able to save it, right?  So it's a mandatory, I think it's a mandatory field, but you do have a task management where you want to track whatever that you need to do for the day.  And it should show up here in your My Task Management. Like, what are those that you need to complete for today or tomorrow or the next week?

1:43:42 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Again, let me know if that is something you're looking for or you would really need it to be in the billing schedule interface.  So I think what's important for all of us is that we see... talking, we'll see you next week... ...  You Um, our work, when things are, are, are tentatively scheduled. So, you know, how we see that out, like here, whether it's on a calendar and how we see that out, um, that's, that's what's important, right?  So that we can see it by the, and we can, you know, get the report by the week or by the month, just like we do today, just like you can do in this software.  Uh, the issue is, because things change, whether it's a task or whether it's a work order, it changes a lot that, um, I don't want to schedule something that I need to schedule for two weeks from now, but I'm not ready to do everything that, that the work order is requiring.  I see what you're saying. Um, I'll try to answer this one first. Uh, I think you, Cobb, has a, has an idea, but if I am to recommend, something, so if, if a work order isn't ready to be scheduled yet, what you could probably do is to assign yourself a task so that you get reminded to.

1:45:00 - Cob Bautista
  do that when the work order is needed for this specific time. So you can just manually add your task for yourself and then whatever that you need to do for tomorrow or for the next day, right?  And then create that task. Anything or any task that you have created in the task management collectively from all the different jobs available here in our pipeline should show in your profile under your My Task Management.  And that's how you can, like, filter out what you need to do for the day or what spending for you to do that is also tied up to a specific job.  If you click that, let's say, again, you click this task right here. If you click this, you know exactly, you know, what job card this is associated with.  That's my, I think, is the best way to do it. But let me hear out Cobb here, what he thinks.  Actually, that's, that is one option. option. But if you want to go to the part where you guys are just, you know, create the task, you just have, you you don't have like a projection where you guys will be implementing or executing this task.  Other option that I'm thinking is we can like add a confidence scoring for that specific task. So what this mean is, but this will be like a whole big workflow, a different workflow.  But I'm just saying that it is possible and we can like make it more efficient. So for example, you guys created like a task or a work order, but haven't formed the crew yet.  So you're just planning to, you know, procure the materials, get the crew involved. But so you don't have, you know, the solid date for the time where you guys will be implementing this.  So it will be like in a limbo for a moment until such time that you guys will be putting there a date.

1:46:56 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So what I'm proposing is there's a... We can, like I said, this will be like a different big workflow, but what we can do is if we can do is if we will be reaching that part, then we can add like a confidence level for that work order.  What it means is it will check the dates, you know, like it will just give like a projection on where you can probably, you know, add this maybe after two weeks you guys will be adding a date.  So it will give like a projection of what date you can choose based on the frequency or based on the work order that, you know, that is, you know, within that day or before that day.  So it will give you an option on, you know, when to set that date so that the crew will, you know, will move to implement or work with that project.  So, Jacob, I'm kind of following that, but it does seem like it would take a lot of resources. to get there.  My question is this, and my next meeting is in 10 minutes, so you guys can continue on, but I got another online meeting at 6.  But what if in the work order, so whether it's a task or a work order, we can argue the difference between those two later, but to me, it's just a marker, a marker that can turn into a finite work order eventually.
  ACTION ITEM: Add 'Pending' work order status; hide from crew portal until Ready - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=6496.9999  What if, on the cruise, if we had another crew that's called pending?

1:48:35 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So, no, I'm putting all the information I want to in this work order. I'm still preparing a work order.  The work order is going to secure me a spot on the calendar for two weeks from now, three weeks from now, four weeks from now.

1:48:47 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  But I don't really know who my crew is going to be that day. I don't know yet. But let me put all this other information in.  Hey, I got the call. They're definitely going to do it on the 12th of March. I move it from the crew pending to who the actual.  crew is. Would that be an easy, would that be easier to program than changing how we do it?

1:49:10 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Because I like the idea of the spots on the calendar. It's what we do now. Taking apart, having a report that says, hey, here's everything I'm doing this month, here's everything I'm doing this week, which is the report functionality, right?  Not this. But maybe we just have a crew that's pending. I'm not ready to commit 100%. I'm committing, but not 100%.  Like such as assigning a crew here and then adding a projected time when you would need it? No, I'd still put it on whatever date, like I was going to do the work order.  But instead of assigning it to crew one or two, I'm assigning it to pending. If I assign it to pending, can I go back the day before, three weeks out, and can I change it to crew one?  And not screw up what you have programmed here. That is actually more straightforward.

1:50:05 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Yeah, yeah, I think so too. We'll just have to change the status of the, you know, of this work order.  Let's say this work order, right?

1:50:15 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  And just pretend that there's nothing in here.

1:50:18 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  It's just really that Wayne would like to create a work order that he knows is going to come out in the next week or two.  And then we'll just change the status here to just ending. Right here. Oh, sorry. This one's different. Pending manager review.  But we want to say like pending work order. So it should show up here as well in the work order section of the job.  Sorry, let me just go back. So in the work order section of the job that shows pending for the status.  And then for the work order calendar here, should show as well in here, but it has like a blank.  Thank you. It's late while it's still pending. It's a marker. I'm going to do it right now. I'm thinking I'm going to do it on this date, but I really don't know.  And I don't want to commit right now. I don't want to put crews to it. I don't want to do a lot of that.  I just want a marker there. Just a marker in the calendar.

1:51:14 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Gotcha. Just like this, for example.

1:51:16 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  Correct. And from a monetary standpoint or a forecasting standpoint, that data is being pulled from the schedule of values.

1:51:29 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So what he does there with the scheduling of when this is going to happen doesn't affect anything because the schedule of values now is what's driving that data.  So when Wayne schedules that portion of the job is insignificant from that perspective.

1:51:47 - Wayne McCoy
  Gotcha. And I think that, you know, it's going to take us a month or so of just going through this and just getting a rhythm and saying, okay, this works.  And then figuring out what tweaks will or will not allow us. To move efficiently, because that's what this is all about, without a lot of redundant work.  I don't want to type this and then type it again over here and then cut and paste and do that.  then just, oh, this is a, you guys, just go out and do this work. Yeah. So I think that we can try that.  And hopefully that'll be a cheap, inexpensive way to do it until we really know what we're looking for. Yeah, for sure.  But I just want to make sure that that captures exactly what Wayne is looking for in terms of, like, checking all the forecasted work orders and all of the work orders that are actually happening at the moment or that are already scheduled with a commitment.  Is that what you're looking for? I was going to say, I... It'd be nice once we have this thing kind of out, we can kind of, like Yates was saying, you know, start working with and everything else, just because I'm not wrapping my...

1:53:00 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  My brain around it right now, because how you're showing this work order calendar, I'm assuming is how you guys are portraying how the schedule looks.  By that view, I can't tell if I've got five jobs, if I've got 20 jobs, and what those jobs are.  Secondly, if I create a work order, if I have to assign crews, does that mean the crews are going to be able to see all their jobs?  Yeah, not until you change. Oh, sorry, go ahead. Because that's what I don't want. I don't want them to see anything until the day before.  Yes. I mean, if I have to assign a crew to it, that tells me that they're going to be able to see all their work orders for all the days.  I don't want that. I only want them to see what they're going to be doing for that day. I see.  We can add another... That is here just for it not to trigger an invitation for the crew to view it on their end.

1:54:09 - Chris Yates (Temp Power Systems)
  So yeah, because the only time that they're going to see it on their end or they're going to receive a text message or an email that there is a work order assigned to them is if you change the status for ready for field execution.

1:54:23 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yeah. So I really have not added the status here wherein, you know, you can just sign in, accrue, and then they will not get a notification that they are assigned to a specific work order.  We can definitely add that status up. Yeah. So yeah, that'll be good. And again, Wayne, before you, oh sorry, Chris, before you go, I'll just schedule another call with you and Jacob to meet again to figure out the sales force access.  That's okay. You're on mute. Sorry, trying to get out of this meeting and get into this one. Hey, Diane.  Yeah, okay, yeah, please, let's do that. All right. Then I'll just go ahead and schedule, or Wayne will continue with the presentation of the CRF, okay?
  ACTION ITEM: Revamp Billing Schedule to match Wayne's SF view - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=6925.9999
  ACTION ITEM: Revamp Billing Schedule to match Wayne's SF view - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=6925.9999  Okay. All right. Let me just go on mute. No link, okay. Oh, Chris here. Okay. Let's move on. So now we have the work order calendar, oh, sorry, the work order calendar here looking like this.  Again, we will try to revamp it. The billing schedule, again, we'll try to capture the way that you're trying to view it on your end when you're in Salesforce, right?  And I'm going to be working on that with Markey here. People management, this is another implemented feature. care. There  uh that uh that was just recently added so people management are all your employees or all your contractors you know or crew members that can be added into your database so if you do have a new crew member you want to add you just add it with their information their employment like their ids their position department hourly rate higher date status whether they're an active employee and if they're available for assignment their skill sets if they they have a specific skill that you want to add um you know whatever skill name it is level beginner intermediate advanced or expert the years of experience and you can add more skills to them and certification so um this is to kind of track what certification they have um and you know when it was issued their expiration date even the strategies uh yeah yeah  certificate number and the actual certificate we can upload it here and so so so that's like adding a crew then you've got here a little dashboard of how many total crews you have available for assignments those that are currently assigned and how many certification alerts are there right so like how many are um okay so that's really about the people management here so it's also important for you to i mean question um when are you the person who's adding crew to the database um i very well could be i don't know how yates wants to do that if that's going to be you know um his his end or my end um because currently we don't have that so that's that's new for us but  Yes, sure. And one more thing to note here is that this employee ID is very unique to each crew or to each member because that is what they will need to use to log into their portal or to their own like, you know, CRM.  So let's have this one as an example later on. But that is all about the people management. And yeah, so you do have like several ways here to filter what you want to see here if you want to have a more filtered way to view your crews.  And if you don't have any questions, we can move on to the profile. Yep, I'm good. All right. So profile here is just really your user profile.  You can choose your profile picture, your name, email, address, and phone number here, date of birth. If you want to change your password, it's right here.  As I've mentioned, your credential in the beginning will be Um will be from us. We will get that for you.  And then all you can do is just change or reset your password here. Your task management section is all of the tasks that are assigned to you regardless of where job they come from.  All right. So you'll be able to see it here. So all tasks that are not started, all tasks that are in progress, completed, or even blocked.  All right. We'll also have a implemented a notification here, this button, because you're going to see each time that you are assigned a task that should show up here as well.

1:59:42 - Wayne McCoy
  Or each time that you are mentioned in a specific task or comment, you're also going to see it from here.  And when you click it, just so happen, I don't have a notification right now.

1:59:51 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  But if you click it, it should directly shoot you to the task itself or to that section of the job.  немецкая and theיב.

2:00:05 - Wayne McCoy
  All right, the Submit Ticket Function, Wayne, this is important for you to get a hold of us.

2:00:12 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Let's say that you encounter an issue, you cannot log in or there is an issue with, you know, or a bug that you identified, then you can submit a technical issue report here or a general support ticket type or an urgent issue ticket type because this is linked to our system so that we can, um, we can support you right away whether we go on a phone call together or whether we'll have to, you know, um, investigate further.  Mm-hmm. Okay. All right. That's the submit and then the logout function, of course. Got it. Okay. All right. So if you, uh, do you have any questions or you'd like to have, good to have in those other sections of your portal?  Yeah, like, Like Chris was saying, you know, everything looks great. We'll just have to kind of get into it and just kind of see where, you know, things work and whatnot.  Exactly. Yes. That's the real objective of our piloting phase. And I just want to show you quickly here the log in as a crew member function.  So as I've mentioned earlier, crews, they have a separate or a different vision or an interface. Just for the demo purposes, I'm going to use this for an employee and then access their crew portal.  You should be able to see it, this one. So if I'm a crew, I would see exactly here what I want to see.  I can even view it if I want to look at it on a weekly basis, monthly basis, or a yearly basis.  So let's say monthly basis here. So I know that... I have worked for 38 hours this month already and that this is my scheduled pay gross and then open work orders right now I don't have any open work orders but I do have two completed work orders that's how I would interpret this dashboard right there's a quick view here of the graph here and then quick info of course just about myself here right so if I want to view all of the work orders I can click this or I can just click this right and then the work orders that are assigned to me which are like my today priority work yep so it's gonna show up here all of the work orders that I have completed is gonna show up here as well here if I click one work order let's say I click this one maybe not this one because it's already completed but a completed work order looks like this I  They couldn't make any changes or any edits here anymore because it's already ready for your review. It's going to assign you what task to review it, right?  I can even export it as a PDF if I want to as a crew. Let's say I want to manipulate it.  I don't know that we have that in the demo, but there should be an edit function here. Sorry about that, Wayne, but there should be an edit function here, for example, that I need to make some edits, particularly on the completion notes.  So, oh, here we go. So this is the only section that we can edit, the completion notes. So if I want to change the work status to work complete, ready for Wayne's review, that's you.  It's going to assign you a task automatically to review this work order, then I can do... If there's a need for additional work, it will also going to alert you because you may want to like collaborate with this crew to check whether it requires an extra work order or not.  In progress, if I'm working on it, if I'm still doing my work order here, work order completion notes, additional work performed, again, that's all going to show on your end, Wayne, as an admin or the work order creator, and then the signature here.

2:04:33 - Wayne McCoy
  So this is just, you can like technically imagine that it's on their phone, they're going to have to get that client signature here, you know, whatever here that's signed, and then clear or re-sign for, again, trying to capture the signature, and then save changes.  Okay. Yeah. So. So again, that is also available on your end. When you review the work order, as soon as they say that this work order is complete and ready for your review.  Okay. Yeah. So that's really it. Here in the work order, it's the same thing for the user profile.

2:05:20 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  They'll be able to see your password reset function, but they don't have a task management anymore because technically their task is the work order.

2:05:28 - Wayne McCoy
  Submit ticket. Again, if they encounter any issues accessing their portal, then this is their support system and love out function.  That's it. So the work order. So today's priority work orders. So if there's five work orders assigned to them, those work orders will show up there?  Yes. Okay. And all my work orders.aman. Um, because they're, outside of maybe previous work orders, um, but they're, they're not going to have any work orders that they're going to be able to view that are up and coming outside of that day.

2:06:15 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yes. Okay. Not you select or change the work order status to ready for field execution. Gotcha. Okay. And then, so when they show that stuff, um, and how am I able to manipulate their, their day?  Um, cause I know we were talking about it before and kind of showing you currently how I give them a schedule.  So I have work or I have jobs one, two, three, four, and I want them to go to those jobs in that order.  One, two, three, four, and it gives them the job name, um, the customer name, the. Contact, the address of that job, and all that information.  Is that?

2:07:09 - Wayne McCoy
  That is very possible in the work order.

2:07:12 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So as I've mentioned, the work orders in the particular day is actually stackable. So there could be like 10 work orders scheduled on the 4th, right?  And this stackable or what I mean is this box right here, we can like make it in order or we can drag it and drop it according to how you want to order it.

2:07:42 - Wayne McCoy
  So how do they see it though? Yeah, they would see it when they go to, again, to their profile.

2:07:48 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Say I'm going to log in again as a crew here. Work orders. So the priorities again here would be  In order as well, in the today's priority work. So how do they know what's what though? Do they have to click into that work order to see what job it is?

2:08:12 - Wayne McCoy
  Yes. So I think we can implement here like a button or identifier that this one needs to be done first or they wouldn't be able to click the next work order in case that the first work order isn't done yet.  So can you click on that work order? This one? Okay. To work detail. Just because this one is a work complete already.

2:08:49 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So where's all the job information? The job, yeah, it should be here. The scope of work.
  ACTION ITEM: Add crew portal fields: Customer, Job Name, POC Name; include POC dropdown - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/EwhF_h461Xz1xfx5fbyxA8x3xBbDB4SW?timestamp=7738.9999

2:09:00 - Wayne McCoy
  The materials requirements, sitemap is here, safety notes. Is there an area where it shows who the customer is?

2:09:13 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Yes, here. Customer contact. No, meaning like customer, like ABC Construction. Oh, okay. And like what the job name is.  It should be here. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Phase two power.

2:09:34 - Mark Jalandoni
  Oh, I thought that was just a description of the work order.

2:09:39 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  Oh, Where you have phase two power distribution? Is that the job name or is that the description of the work order?

2:09:48 - Mark Jalandoni
  This is your scope of work.

2:09:51 - Cob Bautista
  The top left-hand corner. The top left.

2:09:55 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  This one? Yeah.

2:09:56 - Cob Bautista
  What is that? Oh, this is the title of the work order. That's what I'm saying. Is there a description, like, is there the customer or the account holder and the opportunity name?  Let me make sure I have that ready. I don't think that we've captured that. Is that correct, Marky, in here?  Just to show the customer's name and the job card, the parent job card?

2:10:33 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  I think not.

2:10:35 - Cob Bautista
  I think it's just basically on the actual work order. Yeah. Is that, okay, we can totally, like, put that up here.  Yes, we can definitely link those details there.

2:10:47 - Wayne McCoy
  So if there are, like, missing details, for example, which is which, which work order is this, or which project is this, we can definitely add a section there where you can just see those information.  And if you want to go in-depth for that project, we can have it linked so that when you see that work order or project, you can see the title, the name of the project, the work order name, or other details like date.  But if you want to go deeper than that, you have to click that project and you will be routed back to the card.

2:11:26 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So is that what you're... But this is like on the view of... This is the portal for crew. Yeah.  Oh, if that would be the case, then we can definitely have that available and only put there the fields that can only be viewed by the crew and not the whole thing, not including the amount and all those things that they don't need.

2:11:47 - Wayne McCoy
  So, yeah, we can definitely put it there somewhere. Yeah. Yeah, because they need to know who they're working for, who the account holder is, what the job name is.  And then who the point of contact is. So I see that there's a number, but there's no name. We need to have a name.  Got it. That's very doable. Okay. And then as far as that, I mean, is that something that I have to manually input?  Or is that going to be pulled from the job itself?

2:12:24 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  It should be added in the work order because the point of contact may be a different person who closed that deal with Jeff, right?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm thinking it should be really different from the point of contact. Let me just go back to the admin portal here.

2:12:44 - Wayne McCoy
  In Salesforce, we have a whole listing of the account and then all contacts associated to that account. And then within that...  In particular account, those contacts are attached to different opportunities, depending upon who the primary contact is, and so forth, so on and so forth.

2:13:14 - Mark Jalandoni
  So if that's something that's available here, that'd be awesome to where we could assign a contact as the primary, and that would be associated to that card.  Gotcha. Gotcha. So POC should be an auto drop-down associated with the work order. Okay, got it. So as you've mentioned, that is, that information or that data is available in Salesforce, right?  Okay. Okay.

2:13:47 - Wayne McCoy
  Yeah, and then if we need to, like if they get a new superintendent, you know, can we add that?  And then that will be the drop-down within that card to where I can, you know, assign whoever.

2:14:00 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  So whatever contact that is from there. Yes, definitely.

2:14:08 - Wayne McCoy
  Just to clarify that point, basically when the information is pulled from Salesforce, all the primary contacts will be included, or not the primary contacts, but all contacts in that opportunity is included.  Got it. Okay. And then you want to have some options in the world order to assign contacts based on the people that you're pulled from the Salesforce.  Yeah, that's great. Yeah, because, you know, yeah, like I said, in general, how Salesforce has it is there's a primary that we assign.  So we assign those contacts as to, let me pull something up just so I can. Maybe, yeah, if you can show that to us.  Where we where we take that data from. Oh, yeah, I can see here. OK, so. In this particular case.  So if you can see this where it shows contact roles right here, this is currently all the contacts that Jeff had assigned for this particular opportunity, which is Jefferson Fontana right here.  So if I click into that, there's a card here that shows these three contacts that are associated to this particular opportunity.  Craig Ward is the superintendent, and he's our primary contact for this job. Disregarding the fact that, you know, there's other.  Or other contacts that Jeff spoke to regarding this particular opportunity, Craig Ward is the main contact for this job.  So I'm not sure how that would get translated over to you guys, if that's something that you guys are able to pull, you know, that information to.

2:16:24 - Mark Jalandoni
  But as I was showing, like if, if we needed to, if Craig Ward, you know, or if I, they had a new superintendent, you know, I'm able to add.  Yeah, I think through here, I have to actually do it from their account or whatever, but I can add a contact and then I can assign it to, you know, that particular opportunity.  And then I can assign their role within that opportunity.

2:16:54 - Wayne McCoy
  And so whoever the primary is, is where I'm thinking.

2:17:00 - Fiona Cafe (Aivate)
  We can, if through your guys' deal, whoever the primary is, or we have multiple contacts, I can just scroll through and click on that contact or whatever, or if I need to do it manually, I can.  Gotcha. That makes sense. So basically, what's going to happen on the CRM is when a new part is introduced to the CRM because of the sales force, it will pull those contacts together with the other information that Jacob's going to pull.  And then, in the work order that you're going to create, there will be options for you to choose from based on the contacts that was pulled, and at the same time, you will be able to add.  Add more. Gotcha. Perfect. And then you can assign who's the primary. Yeah, that, yeah. Got it, got it. Yep.  We've taken note of that. Is there anything else you'd like to add? I don't think so. And I do think that is just the first line of or list of things that you foresee that you would like to be added, right?

2:18:20 - Wayne McCoy
  But definitely when you are already working inside the CRM, you may want to, you know, take note of additional things that you foresee or that you identified that needs to be added there so we can discuss that in our next session.

2:18:32 - Cob Bautista
  Oh, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Awesome. We'll definitely share with you the live CRM link very, very soon.  But allow us some time here to make some changes or revisions with the current setup yet, referencing from our discussions today.  Cool. Yeah. No, thank you guys so much for your hard work. Of course. Thank you as well for the trust and for this opportunity to work with you.  Yeah, for sure. Thank you so much for your time. I'll set up another meeting. Thank you guys. Thank you so much, Wayne.  Yeah, you guys have a good evening. All right. Take care. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
