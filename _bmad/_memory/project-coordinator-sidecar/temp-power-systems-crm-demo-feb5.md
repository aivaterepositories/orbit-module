## 🚨 Critical Gap Identified

### Materials ↔ Work Orders Link Missing

**Problem:** Mark (shop/production) cannot see what materials are needed for each work order.

**Chris's Use Case:**
> "So Mark comes in on Monday and he's trying to figure out what his work schedule is. He's preparing for all the work orders that are scheduled for this week. How does he see that?"

> "So he sees the jobs on the calendar, but how does he double check that he's got everything prepared for them to take out to that job?"

**Impact:**
- Mark can't prep materials for the week's work orders
- Crew members don't know what to load on their truck
- This is "the part that makes a job fail or succeed" per Chris

**Solution Required:**
1. Link materials to specific work orders in the Materials Builder
2. Add a "Work Order" column showing which WO each material is assigned to
3. When viewing a work order, display the linked materials list
4. Crew members see their materials when they click into their assigned work order
