# Buster's Industrial - Shopify Website Optimization

**Status:** Discovery Complete → Demo Phase
**Priority:** High (Demo deadline: Feb 11-12, 2026)
**Client:** Jeff Buster (Owner)
**Project Lead:** Fiona (PM / Process Engineer)
**Lead Developer:** Marky (Shopify)

---

## Project Overview

### Client Profile
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Company** | Buster's Industrial |
| **Owner** | Jeff Buster |
| **Website** | BustersIndustrial.com (Shopify) |
| **Business** | Industrial hardware + Fleet management |
| **Featured Product** | Diamond blades / Diamond saw blades |
| **Location** | TBD |

### Problem Statement
- **High bounce rate** — visitors leave without browsing or purchasing
- **Clunky design** — website looks unattractive, not converting
- **Poor product organization** — top movers not prominently displayed
- **Trust issues** — Jeff has been burned by multiple "Shopify experts"
- **Budget constrained** — has paid a lot already for failed revamps

### Client Goals
1. Improve conversions — turn visitors into buyers
2. Load top-movers first — especially diamond blades
3. Reorganize & clean up — products and pages
4. Match competitor quality — inspired by ShopCaterpillar.com

## Technical Analysis (Feb 4, 2026)

### Current Website Issues

| Issue | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Script bloat** | Critical | Heavy tracking code (GA, FB Pixel, TikTok) without lazy-loading |
| **Slow page load** | Critical | Primary driver of high bounce rate |
| **Truncated content** | High | Product names/descriptions cut off mid-text |
| **Dated design** | High | Limited visual hierarchy, doesn't inspire confidence |
| **No prominent search** | Medium | Industrial buyers search by part number |
| **Missing trust signals** | Medium | No testimonials/certifications above fold |
| **Deep navigation** | Medium | Multiple clicks to find products |

### Benchmark: ShopCaterpillar.com

**Why Jeff loves it:**
- Modern, clean design
- Fast loading (lazy-load images)
- Sticky header with persistent navigation
- Stock urgency indicators ("Only X left!")
- Carousel-based featured sections
- Strong, clear CTAs
- Professional trust signals

**Goal:** Match or exceed ShopCaterpillar's quality

## Project Approach

### Constraints
- **Budget-conscious** — no full rebuild
- **Use existing Shopify** — reorganize, don't rebuild
- **Quick wins focus** — high impact, low effort changes
- **Timeline** — Demo ready by Feb 11-12

### Strategy
1. Fiona provides Marky access to Jeff's Shopify (today)
2. Marky inspects current setup and identifies what can be reused
3. Redesign using existing assets — reorganize for better UX
4. E-commerce expert consultation (already conducted earlier this month)
5. Prepare demo for Jeff by Feb 11-12

### NOT Using These as Standards
The following competitor sites were reviewed but deemed too clunky:
- Grainger.com
- ro.com
- Imperial.com
- WorthUSA.com
- BladesDirect.net
- DiamondBladeTheWarehouse.com

**Only benchmark:** ShopCaterpillar.com

## Client Relationship Notes

### Handling Jeff's Trust Issues
- Jeff has been "burned multiple times" by fake Shopify experts
- He's paid a lot already for failed website revamps
- **Our approach:** Move carefully, not slowly
- Communicate that we understand his past experience
- Deliver quality over speed — but maintain momentum

### Opportunity
- This is the initial project
- If successful → long-term partnership potential
- More projects with Jeff expected after first success

### Client Temperature
- Not in a rush
- But Fiona is mindful of maintaining his interest
- Demo by Feb 11-12 keeps engagement high

## Focus Areas for Redesign

### Primary (Must Have for Demo)
1. **Diamond Blades** — Featured prominently as hero/primary collection
2. **Fleet Management** — Secondary focus
3. **Speed optimization** — Remove/defer unnecessary scripts
4. **Clean, modern layout** — Match ShopCaterpillar aesthetic
5. **Mobile responsive** — Clean mobile experience

### Secondary (Nice to Have)
1. Stock urgency indicators
2. Trust signals (testimonials, certifications)
3. Improved search functionality
4. Exit-intent or sticky cart
