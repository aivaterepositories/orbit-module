# ORBIT Module Brief

**Module Name:** orbit
**Created:** 2026-02-01
**Author:** Cob
**Status:** Draft

## Executive Summary

ORBIT (Operational Resource for Business Innovation & Team delivery) is a comprehensive enterprise-level project management and delivery system designed to streamline workflows using Scrum methodology with advanced risk management capabilities. The module implements a **Dual Engine Model** that runs Process Engineering and System/Product/Project Development simultaneously, following the **Discover > Demo > Deliver > Defend** lifecycle for accelerated delivery.

## Core Mission

To provide fool-proof, scalable project deliverables through integrated project management, operational support, continuous improvement ideation, and full SDLC implementation while maintaining enterprise-level quality standards and security protocols.

## The Dual Engine Model

ORBIT operates on a dual-track approach:

1. **Engine 1: Process Engineering**
   - Continuous process improvement
   - Workflow optimization
   - Standards development
   - Methodology refinement

2. **Engine 2: System/Product/Project Development**
   - Active development work
   - Implementation execution
   - Technical delivery
   - Quality assurance

Both engines run **simultaneously** to enable rapid iteration and delivery.

## Journey Map Lifecycle

All ORBIT projects follow the **4D Framework**:

1. **Discover** - Requirements gathering, research, planning, risk identification
2. **Demo** - Prototyping, proof of concept, stakeholder validation
3. **Deliver** - Implementation, testing, deployment, documentation
4. **Defend** - Review, audit, security validation, production readiness

## Team Structure

ORBIT supports collaborative work across three primary users:

- **Cob** - Project lead and primary stakeholder
- **Marky** - Team member and contributor
- **Fiona** - Team member and module user

The system assigns tasks, sends reminders via email for pending action items, and maintains context awareness for quick high-level reporting.

5. **Technical Writer Agent** - Documentation creation, onboarding/offboarding materials
6. **UI/UX Designer Agent** - Premium design standards, user experience optimization
7. **Backend Architect Agent** - Schema design, data organization, enterprise architecture
8. **Integration Specialist Agent** - Multi-platform integration, API management
9. **QA & Audit Agent** - Testing, review, production readiness validation
10. **Operations Coordinator Agent** - Task assignment, reminders, status reporting

## Required Workflows

### Core Workflows
1. **Initialize Project** - Set up new project following Dual Engine Model
2. **Sprint Planning** - Plan sprint using Scrum methodology
3. **Risk Assessment** - Conduct risk analysis and mitigation planning
4. **Process Improvement** - Brainstorm and implement workflow optimizations

### SDLC Workflows
5. **Design UI/UX** - Create premium interface designs

11. **Deploy to Production** - Production deployment with security checks
12. **Generate Reports** - Create context-aware status reports

### Integration & Support Workflows
13. **Configure Integration** - Set up multi-platform integrations
14. **Onboard Project** - Create onboarding documentation and processes
15. **Offboard Project** - Document lessons learned and archive

## Journey Map Integration

Each workflow maps to the 4D lifecycle:

- **Discover**: Initialize Project, Risk Assessment, Design UI/UX, Architect Backend
- **Demo**: Develop Feature (prototyping), Review & Audit (preliminary)
